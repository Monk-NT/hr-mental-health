For reasons that I'm sure had to do with a reluctance to accept the
reality that my mind was dissolving, I had avoided seeking psychiatric aid during the past weeks, as
my distress intensified. But I knew I couldn't delay the confrontation indefinitely, and when I did
finally make contact by telephone with a highly recommended therapist, he encouraged me to make
the Paris trip, telling me that he would see me as soon as I returned. I very much needed to get back,
and fast. Despite the evidence that I was in serious difficulty, I wanted to maintain the rosy view. A lot
of the literature available concerning depression is, as I say, breezily optimistic, spreading assurances
that nearly all depressive states will be stabilized or reversed if only the suitable antidepressant can be
found; the reader is of course easily swayed by promises of quick remedy. In Paris, even as I delivered
my remarks, I had a need for the day to be over, felt a consuming urgency to fly to America and the
office of the doctor, who would whisk my malaise away with his miraculous medications. I recollect
that moment clearly now,and am hardly able to believe that I possessed such ingenuous hope, or that I
could have been so unaware of the trouble and peril that lay ahead.
Simone del Duca, a large dark-haired woman of queenly manner, was understandably incredulous at
first, and then enraged, when after the presentation ceremony I told her that I could not join her at
lunch upstairs in the great mansion, along with a dozen or so members of the Academic Franchise,
who had chosen me for the prize. My refusal was both emphatic and simpleminded; I told her pointblank
that I had arranged instead to have lunch at a restaurant with my French publisher, Franchise
Gallimard. Of course this decision on my part was outrageous; it had been announced months before
to me and everyone else concerned that a luncheon--moreover, a luncheon in my honor--was part of
the day's pageantry. But my behavior was really the result of the illness, which had progressed far
enough to produce some of its most famous and sinister hallmarks: confusion, failure of mental focus
and lapse of memory. At a later stage my entire mind would be dominated by anarchic
disconnections;
as I have said, there was now something that resembled bifurcation of mood: lucidity of sorts in the
early hours of the day, gathering murk in the afternoon and evening. It must have been during the
previous evening's murky distracted ness that I made the luncheon date with Franchise Gallimard,
forgetting my del Duca obligations. That decision continued to completely master my thinking,
creating in me such obstinate determination that now I was able to blandly insult the worthy Simone
del Duca.
"Alors!" she exclaimed to me, and her face flushed angrily as she whirled in a stately volte-face, "au . , .
re-voir!" Suddenly I was flabbergasted, stunned with horror at what I had done. I fantasized a table at
which sat the hostess and the Academic Franchise, the guest of honor at La Coupole. I implored
Madame's assistant, a bespectacled woman with a clipboard and an ashen, mortified expression, to try
to reinstate me: it was all a terrible mistake, a mixup, a malentendu. And then I blurted some words
that a lifetime of general equilibrium, and a smug belief in the impregnability of my psychic health,
had prevented me from believing I could ever utter; I was chilled as I heard myself speak them to this
perfect stranger.
"I'm sick," I said, "unproblemepsychiatrique." Madame del Duca was magnanimous in accepting my
apology and the lunch went off without further strain, although I couldn't completely rid myself of the
suspicion, as we chatted somewhat stiffly, that my
benefactress was still disturbed by my conduct and thought me a weird number. The lunch was a long
one, and when it was over I felt myself entering the afternoon shadows with their encroaching anxiety
and dread. A television crew from one of the national channels was waiting (I had forgotten about
them, too), ready to take me to the newly opened Picasso Museum, where I was supposed to be filmed
looking at the exhibits and exchanging comments with Rose. This turned out to be, as I knew it would,
not a captivating promenade but a demanding struggle, a major ordeal.
By the time we arrived at the museum, having dealt with heavy traffic, it was past four o'clock and my
brain had begun to endure its familiar siege: panic and dislocation, and a sense that my thought
processes were being engulfed by a toxic and unnameable tide that obliterated any enjoyable response
to the living world. This is to say more specifically that instead of pleasure--certainly instead of the
pleasure I should be having in this sumptuous showcase of bright genius-- I was feeling in my mind a
sensation close to, but indescribably different from, actual pain. This leads me to touch again on the
elusive nature of such distress.
That the word "indescribable" should present itself is not fortuitous, since it has to be emphasized that
if the pain were readily describable most of the countless sufferers from this ancient affliction would
have been able to confidently depict for their friends and loved ones (even their physicians) some of
the actual dimensions of their torment, and perhaps elicit a comprehension that has been generally
lacking; such incomprehension has usually been due not to a failure of sympathy but to the basic
inability of healthy people to imagine a form of torment so alien to everyday experience. For myself,
the pain is most closely connected to drowning or suffocation--but even these images are off the mark.
William James, who battled depression for many years, gave up the search for an adequate portrayal,
implying its near-impossibility when he wrote in The Varieties of Religious Experience: "It is a positive
and active anguish, a sort of psychical neuralgia wholly unknown to normal life."
The pain persisted during my museum tour and reached a crescendo in the next few hours when, back
at the hotel, I fell onto the bed and lay gazing at the ceiling, nearly immobilized and in a trance of
supreme discomfort. Rational thought was usually absent from my mind at such times, hence trance. I
can think of no more apposite word for this state of being, a condition of helpless stupor in which
cognition was replaced by that "positive and active anguish." And one of the most unendurable
aspects of such an interlude was the inability to sleep. It had been my custom of a near lifetime, like
that of vast numbers of people, to settle myself into a soothing nap in the late afternoon, but the
disruption of normal sleep patterns is a notoriously devastating feature of depression; to the injurious
sleeplessness with which I had been afflicted each night was added the insult of this afternoon
insomnia, diminutive by comparison but all the more horrendous because it struck during the hours
of the most intense misery. It had become clear that I would never be granted even a few minutes'
relief from my full-time exhaustion. I clearly recall thinking, as I lay there while Rose sat nearby
reading, that my afternoons and evenings were becoming almost measurably worse, and that this
episode was the worst to date. But I somehow managed to reassemble myself for dinner with--who
else?--Franchoise Gallimard, co-victim along with Simone del Duca of the frightful lunchtime
contretemps.
The night was blustery and raw, with a chill wet wind blowing down the avenues, and when Rose
and I met Franchise and her son and a friend at La Lorraine, a glittering brasserie not far from L'Etoile,
rain was descending from the heavens in torrents. Someone in the group, sensing my state of mind,
apologized for the evil night, but I recall thinking that even if this were one of those warmly scented
and passionate evenings for which Paris is celebrated I would respond like the zombie I had become.
The weather of depression is unmodulated, its light a brownout.
And zombie like halfway through the dinner, I lost the del Duca prize check for $25,000. Having
tucked the check in the inside breast pocket of my jacket, I let my hand stray idly to that place and
realized that it was gone. Did I "intend" to lose the money? Recently I had been deeply bothered that I
was not deserving of the prize. I believe in the reality of the accidents we subconsciously perpetrate on
ourselves, and so how easy it was for this loss to be not loss but a form of repudiation, offshoot of that
self-loathing (depression's premier badge) by which I was persuaded that I could not be worthy of the
prize, that I was in fact not worthy of any of the recognition that had come my way in the past few
years. Whatever the reason for its disappearance, the check was gone, and its loss dovetailed well with
the other failures of the dinner: my failure to have an appetite for the grand plateau de fruits de mer
placed before me, failure of even forced laughter and, at last, virtually total failure of speech. At this
point the ferocious inwardness of the pain produced an immense distraction that prevented my
articulating words beyond a hoarse murmur; I sensed myself turning walleyed, monosyllabic, and
also I sensed my French friends becoming uneasily aware of my predicament. It was a scene from a
bad operetta by now: all of us near the floor, searching for the vanished money. Just as I signaled that
it was time to go, Franchise's son discovered the check, which had somehow slipped out of my pocket
and fluttered under an adjoining table, and we went forth into the rainy night. Then, while I was
riding in the car, I thought of Albert Camus and Remain Gary.
