‘I’m getting on very well,’ he said.
‘Have you drunk your tea?’ asked the son.
‘Yes, and enjoyed it.’
‘Shall I give you some more?’
The old man considered, placidly. ‘Well, I guess I’ll
wait and see.’ He had, in speaking, the American tone.
‘Are you cold?’ the son enquired.
The father slowly rubbed his legs. ‘Well, I don’t know.
I can’t tell till I feel.’
‘Perhaps some one might feel for you,’ said the
younger man, laughing.
‘Oh, I hope some one will always feel for me! Don’t
you feel for me, Lord Warburton?’
‘Oh yes, immensely,’ said the gentleman addressed as
Lord Warburton, promptly. ‘I’m bound to say you look
wonderfully comfortable.’
‘Well, I suppose I am, in most respects.’ And the old
man looked down at his green shawl and smoothed it over
his knees. ‘The fact is I’ve been comfortable so many years
that I suppose I’ve got so used to it I don’t know it.’
‘Yes, that’s the bore of comfort,’ said Lord Warburton.
‘We only know when we’re uncomfortable.’
‘It strikes me we’re rather particular,’ his companion
remarked.
‘Oh yes, there’s no doubt we’re particular,’ Lord
Warburton murmured. And then the three men remained
silent a while; the two younger ones standing looking
down at the other, who presently asked for more tea. ‘I
should think you would be very unhappy with that shawl,’
Lord Warburton resumed while his companion filled the
old man’s cup again.
‘Oh no, he must have the shawl!’ cried the gentleman
in the velvet coat. ‘Don’t put such ideas as that into his
head.’
‘It belongs to my wife,’ said the old man simply.
‘Oh, if it’s for sentimental reasons-’ And Lord
Warburton made a gesture of apology.
‘I suppose I must give it to her when she comes,’ the
old man went on.
‘You’ll please to do nothing of the kind. You’ll keep it
to cover your poor old legs.’
‘Well, you mustn’t abuse my legs,’ said the old man. ‘I
guess they are as good as yours.’
‘Oh, you’re perfectly free to abuse mine,’ his son
replied, giving him his tea.
‘Well, we’re two lame ducks; I don’t think there’s
much difference.’
‘I’m much obliged to you for calling me a duck. How’s
your tea?’
‘Well, it’s rather hot.’
‘That’s intended to be a merit.’
‘Ah, there’s a great deal of merit,’ murmured the old
man, kindly. ‘He’s a very good nurse, Lord Warburton.’
‘Isn’t he a bit clumsy?’ asked his lordship.
‘Oh no, he’s not clumsy—considering that he’s an
invalid himself. He’s a very good nurse—for a sick-nurse. I
call him my sick-nurse because he’s sick himself.’
‘Oh, come, daddy!’ the ugly young man exclaimed.
‘Well, you are; I wish you weren’t. But I suppose you
can’t help it.’
‘I might try: that’s an idea,’ said the young man.
‘Were you ever sick, Lord Warburton?’ his father
asked.
Lord Warburton considered a moment. ‘Yes, sir, once,
in the Persian Gulf.’
He’s making light of you, daddy,’ said the other young
man. ‘That’s a sort of joke.’
‘Well, there seem to be so many sorts now,’ daddy
replied, serenely. ‘You don’t look as if you had been sick,
any way, Lord Warburton.’
‘He’s sick of life; he was just telling me so; going on
fearfully about it,’ said Lord Warburton’s friend.
‘Is that true, sir?’ asked the old man gravely.
‘If it is, your son gave me no consolation. He’s a
wretched fellow to talk to—a regular cynic. He doesn’t
seem to believe in anything.’
‘That’s another sort of joke,’ said the person accused of
cynicism.
‘It’s because his health is so poor,’ his father explained
to Lord Warburton. ‘It affects his mind and colours his
way of looking at things; he seems to feel as if he had
never had a chance. But it’s almost entirely theoretical,
you know; it doesn’t seem to affect his spirits. I’ve hardly
ever seen him when he wasn’t cheerful—about as he is at
present. He often cheers me up.’
The young man so described looked at Lord
Warburton and laughed. ‘Is it a glowing eulogy or an
accusation of levity? Should you like me to carry out my
theories, daddy?’
‘By Jove, we should see some queer things!’ cried Lord
Warburton.
‘I hope you haven’t taken up that sort of tone,’ said the
old man.
‘Warburton’s tone is worse than mine; he pretends to
be bored. I’m not in the least bored; I find life only too
interesting.’
‘Ah, too interesting; you shouldn’t allow it to be that,
you know!’
‘I’m never bored when I come here,’ said Lord
Warburton. ‘One gets such uncommonly good talk.’
‘Is that another sort of joke?’ asked the old man.
‘You’ve no excuse for being bored anywhere. When I was
your age I had never heard of such a thing.’
‘You must have developed very late.’
‘No, I developed very quick; that was just the reason.
When I was twenty years old I was very highly developed
indeed. I was working tooth and nail. You wouldn’t be
bored if you had something to do; but all you young men
are too idle. You think too much of your pleasure. You’re
too fastidious, and too indolent, and too rich.’
