Under certain circumstances there are few hours in life
more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony
known as afternoon tea. There are circumstances in
which, whether you partake of the tea or not—some
people of course never do—the situation is in itself
delightful. Those that I have in mind in beginning to
unfold this simple history offered an admirable setting to
an innocent pastime. The implements of the little feast had
been disposed upon the lawn of an old English countryhouse,
in what I should call the perfect middle of a
splendid summer afternoon. Part of the afternoon had
waned, but much of it was left, and what was left was of
the finest and rarest quality. Real dusk would not arrive
for many hours; but the flood of summer light had begun
to ebb, the air had grown mellow, the shadows were long
upon the smooth, dense turf. They lengthened slowly,
however, and the scene expressed that sense of leisure still
to come which is perhaps the chief source of one’s
enjoyment of such a scene at such an hour. From five
o’clock to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but
on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an
eternity of pleasure. The persons concerned in it were
taking their pleasure quietly, and they were not of the sex
which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the
ceremony I have mentioned. The shadows on the perfect
lawn were straight and angular; they were the shadows of
an old man sitting in a deep wicker-chair near the low
table on which the tea had been served, and of two
younger men strolling to and fro, in desultory talk, in front
of him. The old man had his cup in his hand; it was an
unusually large cup, of a different pattern from the rest of
the set and painted in brilliant colours. He disposed of its
contents with much circumspection, holding it for a long
time close to his chin, with his face turned to the house.
His companions had either finished their tea or were
indifferent to their privilege; they smoked cigarettes as
they continued to stroll. One of them, from time to time,
as he passed, looked with a certain attention at the elder
man, who, unconscious of observation, rested his eyes
upon the rich red front of his dwelling. The house that
rose beyond the lawn was a structure to repay such
consideration and was the most characteristic object in the
peculiarly English picture I have attempted to sketch.
It stood upon a low hill, above the river—the river
being the Thames at some forty miles from London. A
long gabled front of red brick, with the complexion of
which time and the weather had played all sorts of
pictorial tricks, only, however, to improve and refine it,
presented to the lawn its patches of ivy, its clustered
chimneys, its windows smothered in creepers. The house
had a name and a history; the old gentleman taking his tea
would have been delighted to tell you these things: how it
had been built under Edward the Sixth, had offered a
night’s hospitality to the great Elizabeth (whose august
person had extended itself upon a huge, magnificent, and
terribly angular bed which still formed the principal
honour of the sleeping apartments), had been a good deal
bruised and defaced in Cromwell’s wars, and then, under
the Restoration, repaired and much enlarged; and how,
finally, after having been remodelled and disfigured in the
eighteenth century, it had passed into the careful keeping
of a shrewd American banker, who had bought it
originally because (owing to circumstances too
complicated to set forth) it was offered at a great bargain:
bought it with much grumbling at its ugliness, its
antiquity, its incommodity, and who now, at the end of
twenty years, had become conscious of a real aesthetic
passion for it, so that he knew all its points and would tell
you just where to stand to see them in combination and
just the hour when the shadows of its various
protuberances—which fell so softly upon the warm, weary
brickwork—were of the right measure. Besides this, as I
have said, he could have counted off most of the
successive owners and occupants, several of whom were
known to general fame; doing so, however, with an
undemonstrative conviction that the latest phase of its
destiny was not the least honourable. The front of the
house overlooking that portion of the lawn with which
we are concerned was not the entrance-front; this was in
quite another quarter. Privacy here reigned supreme, and
the wide carpet of turf that covered the level hill-top
seemed but the extension of a luxurious interior. The
great still oaks and beeches flung down a shade as dense as
that of velvet curtains; and the place was furnished, like a
room, with cushioned seats, with rich-coloured rugs, with
the books and papers that lay upon the grass. The river
was at some distance; where the ground began to slope,
the lawn, properly speaking, ceased. But it was none the
less a charming walk down to the water.
The old gentleman at the tea-table, who had come
from America thirty years before, had brought with him,
at the top of his baggage, his American physiognomy; and
he had not only brought it with him, but he had kept it in
the best order, so that, if necessary, he might have taken it
back to his own country with perfect confidence. At
present, obviously, nevertheless, he was not likely to
displace himself; his journeys were over, and he was taking
the rest that precedes the great rest. He had a narrow,
clean-shaven face, with features evenly distributed and an
expression of placid acuteness. It was evidently a face in
which the range of representation was not large, so that
the air of contented shrewdness was all the more of a
merit. It seemed to tell that he had been successful in life,
yet it seemed to tell also that his success had not been
exclusive and invidious, but had had much of the
inoffensiveness of failure. He had certainly had a great
experience of men, but there was an almost rustic
simplicity in the faint smile that played upon his lean,
spacious cheek and lighted up his humorous eye as he at
last slowly and carefully deposited his big tea-cup upon the
table. He was neatly dressed, in well-brushed black; but a
shawl was folded upon his knees, and his feet were
encased in thick, embroidered slippers. A beautiful collie
dog lay upon the grass near his chair, watching the
master’s face almost as tenderly as the master took in the
still more magisterial physiognomy of the house; and a
little bristling, bustling terrier bestowed a desultory
attendance upon the other gentlemen.
One of these was a remarkably well-made man of fiveand-
thirty, with a face as English as that of the old
gentleman I have just sketched was something else; a
noticeably handsome face, fresh-coloured, fair and frank,
with firm, straight features, a lively grey eye and the rich
adornment of a chestnut beard. This person had a certain
fortunate, brilliant exceptional look—the air of a happy
temperament fertilized by a high civilization—which
would have made almost any observer envy him at a
venture. He was booted and spurred, as if he had
dismounted from a long ride; he wore a white hat, which
looked too large for him; he held his two hands behind
him, and in one of them—a large, white, well-shaped
fist—was crumpled a pair of soiled dog-skin gloves.
His companion, measuring the length of the lawn
beside him, was a person of quite a different pattern, who,
although he might have excited grave curiosity, would
not, like the other, have provoked you to wish yourself,
almost blindly, in his place. Tall, lean, loosely and feebly
put together, he had an ugly, sickly, witty, charming face,
furnished, but by no means decorated, with a straggling
moustache and whisker. He looked clever and ill—a
combination by no means felicitous; and he wore a brown
velvet jacket. He carried his hands in his pockets, and
there was something in the way he did it that showed the
habit was inveterate. His gait had a shambling, wandering
quality; he was not very firm on his legs. As I have said,
whenever he passed the old man in the chair he rested his
eyes upon him; and at this moment, with their faces
brought into relation, you would easily have seen they
were father and son. The father caught his son’s eye at last
and gave him a mild, responsive smile.
