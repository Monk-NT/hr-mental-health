‘The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to
look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but
there— there you could look at a thing monstrous and
free. It was unearthly, and the men were—No, they were
not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it—
this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come
slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and
made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the
thought of their humanity— like yours—the thought of
your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar.
Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man
enough you would admit to yourself that there ywas in
you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible
frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a
meaning in it which you—you so remote from the night
of first ages—could comprehend. And why not? The mind
of man is capable of anything—because everything is in it,
all the past as well as all the future. What was there after
all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage—who can
tell?— but truth—truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let
the fool gape and shudder—the man knows, and can look
on without a wink. But he must at least be as much of a
man as these on the shore. He must meet that truth with
his own true stuff— with his own inborn strength.
Principles won’t do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags—
rags that would fly off at the first good shake. No; you
want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in this fiendish
row—is there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a
voice, too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that
cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer
fright and fine sentiments, is always safe. Who’s that
grunting? You wonder I didn’t go ashore for a howl and a
dance? Well, no—I didn’t. Fine sentiments, you say? Fine
sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about
with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to
put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes—I tell you. I had
to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags, and get
the tin-pot along by hook or by crook. There was surfacetruth
enough in these things to save a wiser man. And
between whiles I had to look after the savage who was
fireman. He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a
vertical boiler. He was there below me, and, upon my
word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a
parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hindlegs.
A few months of training had done for that really fine
chap. He squinted at the steam-gauge and at the watergauge
with an evident effort of intrepidity—and he had
filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool of his pate
shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on
each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his
hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which
he was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of
improving knowledge. He was useful because he had been
instructed; and what he knew was this—that should the
water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit
inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of
his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance. So he sweated and
fired up and watched the glass fearfully (with an
impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a
piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways
through his lower lip), while the wooded banks slipped
past us slowly, the short noise was left behind, the
interminable miles of silence—and we crept on, towards
Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous
and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky
devil in it, and thus neither that fireman nor I had any
time to peer into our creepy thoughts.
‘Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came
upon a hut of reeds, an inclined and melancholy pole,
with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag of
some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked wood-pile.
This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the
stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with some
faded pencil-writing on it. When deciphered it said:
‘Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach cautiously.’ There
was a signature, but it was illegible—not Kurtz—a much
longer word. ‘Hurry up.’ Where? Up the river? ‘Approach
cautiously.’ We had not done so. But the warning could
not have been meant for the place where it could be only
found after approach. Something was wrong above. But
what—and how much? That was the question. We
commented adversely upon the imbecility of that
telegraphic style. The bush around said nothing, and
would not let us look very far, either. A torn curtain of
red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and flapped
sadly in our faces. The dwelling was dismantled; but we
could see a white man had lived there not very long ago.

There remained a rude table—a plank on two posts; a
heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner, and by the door
I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the pages
had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness;
but the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white
cotton thread, which looked clean yet. It was an
extraordinary find. Its title was, AN INQUIRY INTO
SOME POINTS OF SEAMANSHIP, by a man Towser,
Towson—some such name—Master in his Majesty’s
Navy. The matter looked dreary reading enough, with
illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures, and the
copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing antiquity
with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve
in my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring
earnestly into the breaking strain of ships’ chains and
tackle, and other such matters. Not a very enthralling
book; but at the first glance you could see there a
singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right
way of going to work, which made these humble pages,
thought out so many years ago, luminous with another
than a professional light. The simple old sailor, with his
talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle
and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come
upon something unmistakably real. Such a book being
there was wonderful enough; but still more astounding
were the notes pencilled in the margin, and plainly
referring to the text. I couldn’t believe my eyes! They
were in cipher! Yes, it looked like cipher. Fancy a man
lugging with him a book of that description into this
nowhere and studying it—and making notes—in cipher at
that! It was an extravagant mystery.
‘I had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying
noise, and when I lifted my eyes I saw the wood-pile was
gone, and the manager, aided by all the pilgrims, was
shouting at me from the riverside. I slipped the book into
my pocket. I assure you to leave off reading was like
tearing myself away from the shelter of an old and solid
friendship.
