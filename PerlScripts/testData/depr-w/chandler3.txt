There was a short silence on his end of the line. Then he made up his mind. 'OK, Cheapie. I tell you the whole story and then your curiosity dies, right? Otherwise you do. We were with the British. It happened in Norway, in November 1942. Now you know it all. Now you can rest your tired brain.'
He hung up. I went out and bought a newspaper and read about poor Magoon. Of course, Mendy had promised me worse, because Magoon was a policeman, a dirty cop but still one of the boys, and gangsters don't like to kill policemen. They don't care about private detectives, though. Some days it seems no one does.
Except perhaps another private detective. I called George Peters and asked him to help. He said he would. 'I know a few good people in England. You'll get what you want.'

He didn't disappoint me. When Howard Spencer called the next Friday, I had it all.
He was staying at the Ritz-Beverly Hotel, and he suggested we meet in the bar. But I wanted to talk in private, so I went to his room instead.
He had it nice. The room was big, and the view was good. He ordered our drinks over the telephone.
'Now, Mr Marlowe, what can you tell me before I see Mrs Wade?'
'Nothing.'
He looked at me with surprise. 'I mean concerning Roger Wade's death. I understand you were there.'
I nodded. 'I'd like to come with you to see Mrs Wade,' I said.
Spencer shook his head. 'I don't think she wishes to see you. She blames you, in part, for what happened, I think.'
'She told the police I killed him. I know she doesn't want to see me. That's why I want to go with you. I want a witness to what I have to say to her, too.'
'What are you going to say?'
'You hear it in front of her or not at all,' I said.
'Then not at all. Eileen has suffered enough. I won't take you there to bother her more.'
That made sense. He wanted the book that Wade had been working on. He wanted to save Eileen Wade from more pain. I said that these were fine aims but I didn't share them. All I wanted was a clearer picture. I told him the details that had bothered Ohls.
'My God,' he said, 'the police don't think Eileen did it, do they?'
I didn't tell him the investigation was closed. I just gave him a tired smile and let him do his own thinking.
'You want to talk to her, and you want a witness. I hope to God you're crazy, but I'll do it,' he said finally.

A Big Noise About Small Things
The drive to Idle Valley was long and hot, as always. I expected the heat but Spencer was shocked.
'This heat, this dust. I thought California was supposed to have beautiful weather.'
I told him it would be cooler by the lake.
'It was a mistake for Roger to move here, you know. Wrong environment entirely. Too many parties, this awful heat, no wonder he didn't feel like writing. A writer needs things to think about; and not just what he's going to wear to the next good time.'
I didn't have a chance to disagree with him because we had reached the house. Spencer was out of the car as soon as I had parked, and he rang the bell as soon as he got to the door. Candy, wearing his white jacket and his usual frown, let the publisher in and then closed the door as I approached. I rang and he put his head out.
'Get lost. Or do you want trouble?'
I pushed right past him. He reached for me but Eileen Wade was standing there and he stopped.
'Hello, Howard,' she said warmly to Spencer. 'I'm so sorry you missed lunch. And I didn't know you were bringing Mr Marlowe.'
Spencer said simply 'He wants to talk to you.'
She was surprised. 'Does he? I can't imagine why but do come in and sit down.'
Spencer went at once to the study for the pages Wade had written. I sat in an uncomfortable silence with Eileen Wade until I noticed that she was wearing that badge again. She had just handed it to me when Spencer returned with his pile of papers.
'It's the badge of an English Army group, the Artists' Rifles they were called. The man who gave it to me was lost right afterwards, in Andalsnes in Norway, in 1940.'
'And you were in love with him,' I said.
She admitted it proudly.
'And he had my initials.'
'His name was quite different,' she said coldly, 'and he is dead. Dead.'
I handed the badge to Spencer. He took it without showing interest. 'I've seen it before,' he said.
'Just help me. The picture on it is a long knife that points down and there's a pair of wings, too. The writing on it says "Who dares wins".'
Spencer was unimpressed. 'I fail to see what you are trying to say.'
'This badge she says she was given in London in 1940 didn't exist then. It was created years later. And the Artists' Rifles never fought in Andalsnes.'
Spencer put the badge down gently on the table and pushed it towards Eileen. He said nothing.
'I know that,' Eileen said.

'There must be some mistake,' Spencer offered.
I gave him a hard stare. 'That's one way of putting it,' I said.
'Another way is to say I'm a liar,' Eileen said angrily. 'That I never met a man named Paul Marston, that he never existed, that I bought this badge in a shop somewhere. Would that explanation satisfy you, Mr Marlowe?'
I said the shop would, but not the first part. There had been a Paul Marston once. She had certainly met him. In fact, she had done more than that. I took a folded paper from my pocket.
'She's forgotten a few dates, years, that's all,' Spencer said. 'I don't see why you're being so tough with her.'
I smiled, but not from joy. 'She's forgotten a lot more than that.' I waved the paper from my pocket. 'In August 1942, Eileen Victoria Sampsell and Paul Edward Marston were married. In a sense Mrs Wade is right. Marston never existed because that was just a name he used. In the army you have to have permission to get married. In the army, Marston had another name.'
Spencer was very quiet now. He stared, but not at both of us. He stared at her. She had to say something. 'Howard, he's dead, it doesn't matter. And Roger knew. And he didn't care.'
