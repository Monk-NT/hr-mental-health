At the farm in Poughkeepsie just before dinner the ?rst evening light
is soft and almost violet. Sophie and I cross the grass in the circle drive
by the big locust, the gravel drive stretches just before us and beyond it
the farmhouse lawn where the tables are laid for dinner under the trees.
We are going to see the coop which Sophie has just ?xed up as her
studio. A barren New England shed, a chicken coop—she has transformed it. It is the South now, nearly tropical, “Like a New Orleans
whorehouse," I say, and we laugh. “But it’s perfect." I pace the room,
admiring it, remembering how they called them sporting houses, places
of the afternoon. The last passionate fullness of day, Sophie's straw
mats and bamboo hangings filtering the light. “How clever you are.”
The look between us grows into a suggestion. A quickie? “Do you
suppose there’s time before dinner or will the apprentices catch us in the
act?” she asks. We smile and look around the room at the spectacle of
light, the dark gleam inside, the light outside building, massive as
water, brilliant by contrast, overwhelming like the sea around a boat.
The beauty of what Sophie has created in a few casual hours takes my
breath away. I have known this place for years at nearly every hour of
the day, even worked here, yet I've never seen the room in this light;
Sophie has enchanted the place. This amazing woman, her intelligence,
her knack, her whim and instinct conceptualized, then realized. It's
genius, the way the light is caught and held by her hangings, the bamboo blinds placed at just the right junctures to ?lter and direct the light as it
floods in at the big openings in the wall to the front of the coop on the
southem and westem sides. There's the old camera from her family in
Canada mounted on its tripod as if in explanation, as if the camera had
taken a picture and we were in it. Oceans of light in the lens of the eye
opening to the masses of color in the fervent july sunset beginning now
just out of reach beyond the far westem wall, all the refracted yellows
and reds defused in the air around us — the room has become a camera.
How brilliant she is, this is beyond anything she has shown me before.
Bending over me, courting me, taking me, seducing me — the whole
structure a seduction, the most outrageous compliment that someone
would create this and then pay me the homage of showing it as a private
exhibition that would end in bedding me. The soft of her skin, her bare
shoulder against my lips, the pristine blue sheets under us, cobalt, their
color and the color of the golden light around us, one does not wish to
close one’s eyes, miss it.
And then they burst in on us, pirates of noise, Kim and Libby stumbling
in the door, laughing, knowing full well what they would displace.
Somehow their presence is a compliment to our love, just as they prevent it they also validate and applaud. We look at each other and cannot
find resentment. “Aha, we know just what you're up to, but you're too
late, the food is on the table. ” “Really on the table?" "Really. We give
you two minutes, exactly two minutes." They both laugh. "To make
yourselves decent." How they love it, being young and so full of sex
themselves, its energy, its ripe invitation; sexual appetite is a presence
in the room, its apprehension here is a celebration.
For they love us, as we love them, every day more so, friendship
becoming a drunkenness becoming love, a love none of us de?ne, so we
call it the fann or the colony, as if it were merely an idea, an ideology
of a communal something politically correct. Through it, rapturously
happy. Because of how we live? Because of who we are? Sophie and I
say it's because this year's bunch of apprentices is wonderful, they're
treasures. Calling them the kids, though we know they are young
women, young but already women.
Life has never been so good. The apprentices, the farm, the summer
still ahead, only half over, spreading already to a richness, a perfection,
like a peony in full bloom. Or the loosestrife around the pond. And Sophie. All, I have everything. I am even off the lithium. With no ill
effect. It is six weeks now we have been keeping check on the experiment, and if it works I am whole. Either I was never crazy or I have
recovered and can be sane henceforth. To be whole, not a cracked egg,
not an imperfect specimen, not a deformed intellect or a mental
defective — but whole. It‘s working, I’ll make it.
“Hey, come on, you guys, the cook will have a ?t." We look at each
other, face to face in the circle of bodies in this wonderful light; they are
by the door, between the door and the bed, their shapes already darkened against the light; leaning on an arm, you can smile up at each of
them, in love. With them, with the place, with Sophie. “Come on,
you’re already late.” Discovered now and on our way to dinner, crossing the grass with Sophie, I see the rest of them standing at the table to
toast, their glasses raised, the red wine in the glasses, the last light
cleansing and sparkling the glasses and plates along the straw place
mats, the different, warmer light of kerosene lantems on the wooden
boards of the table, and their long brown arms above their heads, raised
to toast with the pleasure of clinking glasses. “They're a wonderful
bunch," I say again to Sophie as we cross the grass. “The best we ever
had,” she says nodding. This is the happiest summer of my life.

Another morning and I wake up uneasy beside her. Something is
going wrong with us. This new bickering, this vexation. A monstrous
quarrel is growing between us: Sophie is unraveling the thing connecting us, that bright beauty of the early days, our bodies white in the light
of dawn, the mist coming up from the pond, the insatiable greed of our
lust, our love, our tenderness, our rutting tenderness. We were unable
to stop, one grati?cation only calling for another, the wildest improvisations, the never-?nished copulation, franker and more animal than
with any lover I‘d ever known. Fond of the same pleasures, fond of all
pleasures, an in?nite variety of subtle clitoral stimulation, hard vaginal
fucking, anal invention, breasts, eyes, the never-satis?ed mouth; how
easy and endless the going down, the coming up to rest on a nipple or
a kiss or a look — the highest trust, the secret between us, the billy goat
lust of our perfect shamelessness, all borders passed, transcended - 
utterly given to each other, in league.
All those mornings that made our love, forged before those great
windows onto the water, the little willow tree framed in them. The
willow, the bed, the drawing table just above and to the right if you
stand before the big basement windows and look through them to the
pond below. At that big table I drew her. Over and over a thousand
times, sketches and then finished drawings with a Japanese brush, then
poems in them, then silk screens of them. Sophie Sophie Sophie, the
lines of ink making her body, the words so many kisses along its ?esh,
that sweet slender mass, the lines of the brushstroke trying as for salvation to imitate hers, merely imitate the so perfect life before me in the
light of summer, the green beyond the pond and the willow, the waving
grass beyond the white of her haunch, her belly, her buttock, her breast,
the so difficult and tender shoulder.
All unraveling now. We no longer make love, or if we do it is only
a reminder of how things have degenerated that were once so magnificent. When the memory of before sweeps over me it mocks, humiliation colors orgasm; you get off to get it over with. Light a cigarette,
trying to forget, wanting to get up rather than linger: have breakfast.
start working, anything rather than linger, anything to replace this
knowledge, the dead certainty of it. For a while one could say it changes,
love changes, settles, becomes daily no longer paradisical but solid, the
living with rather than the falling in love, the marriage not the wedding.
But it is not that now, because I have known that with Fumio and it was
good.
This is not that; instead it is some mock marriage, some soap opera
of quarrels and jealousy frightening me. Terror and losing and apology
in me. Shrewishness and accusation and declaration in her, the harsh
voice going on annihilating me as I sputter. Hours of this, and I break
my rule and ?nally raise my voice. I don't want a wife, for Christ's sake;
we are not some grotesque married couple, the nineteenth century or the
divorce court or television. We are lovers, friends. Those two things.
But when we are not lovers, we seem unable to be friends.
Maybe it’s my fault for the notion of doing a will, making her my
heir, giving her the farm. Perhaps she was right to reject the idea. Yet
somehow, past her good instinct, another impulse has been unleashed
and given its head. The lady of the manor, which I thought was only
gallantry — we could go about in long dresses and be ladies both, some
evening when we're not quite so busy — some whimsical view of ourselves and the place, a fantasy to play with, like the fantasy of woods-
women, tractor drivers. The fantasy of living in the south of France in
our banquets of lanterns and wildflowers. Good God, it was playing.
But I have now a termagant not a lady, or a lady affronted, more
superior than High Church. I cannot bear that voice. Mostly I cannot
bear that sound of British scorn. Where did she learn that tone, that knife
in the tongue? She with her once soft Canadian accent, the bonny burr
of Scots honey in it when moved, when talking long-distance, when
whispering beloved obscenities. So pure in her lust — the utter cleanness
of spirit that could play at slut and wanton. Randy, horny, and always the fine good of the white of her skin, arms, thighs, hip, her silly knobby
feet, the one imperfection that fascinated me, held me too. However
rank we were, there was always this still purity at the center, this
untouched individuality, this excellent personhood that maintained itself
entire days in bed; when the phone rang, when it was time to have still
another cup of coffee in the big bedroom in the farmhouse, the fire
glowing past the little marble-topped table that held the breakfast china
and the coffee cups. Laughing at the rumpled sheets, the wonder of her
self-composure, lady and woman, adult and something of a girl, who
went to England early, ran away from home, had every adventure, and
was alone, for all the sad and funny stories of poverty or screwing
around or being screwed over by this or that figure in a tale—business
partners who cheated her out of a house, or a guy whom she jilted and
never married. The ordeal of coming apart with Ellen, who is still her
best friend. Through all of it she had arrived in this room untouched. Till
now, till I touch her and we unlock in each other the most surprising and
munificent congmity of sexual energy. That would last a lifetime, that
would build the farm. And look what we have made of it already.
The years I labored here alone are nothing to the dreams and fairy tales
Sophie and I have built in bed: greenhouses, the conversion of the
carriage house, the lavender bam, into an exquisite house — when we‘re
done, we'll put big tubs of lavender ?owers in front under a balcony -
just so, she says. And we laugh and conspire and solve the insoluble
problem of the staircase. We can do anything, we are geniuses of
architecture, plumbing, carpentry, electricity, design and decoration.
Money is no object - if there isn't any, we can't let a thing like that stop
us, ingenuity and our own labor and the "how to" books will see us
through. But most of all, the wonderful inventiveness of her mind. How
blessed I am to have a mate who loves this place. Not to carry the whole
weight of it alone any longer but to have a fellow conspirator in making
it paradise to share with our friends, with the apprentices, with the artists
to come here someday when the cottages are built for them. All the mad
maps of the crops, how many trees will be in the ground in nine years.
how many harvested in ten? I - low the ?rst crop can build the ?rst
cottage, how the thing can go on forever. Even when I die, for I will die
first: she could steward it, make it go on, run it as a farm that supported
all the rest, the colony.
