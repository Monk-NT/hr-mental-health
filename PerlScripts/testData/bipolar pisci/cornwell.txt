The late morning blazed with blue skies and the colors of fall, but none of it was for me. Sunlight and
beauty were for other people now, my life stark and without song. I stared out the window at a neighbor
raking leaves and felt helpless, broken and gone.
Benton's words resurrected every awful image I had repressed. I saw beams of light picking out
heat-shattered bones in soggy trash and water. Shock rocked me again when confusing shapes turned
into a scorched head with no features and clumps of sooty silver hair.
I was sitting at my kitchen table sipping hot tea that Senator Frank Lord had brewed for me. I was
exhausted and light-headed from storms of nausea that had sent me fleeing to the bathroom twice. I was

humiliated, because beyond all things I feared losing control, and I just had.
"I need to rake the leaves again," I inanely said to my old friend. "December sixth and it's like October.
Look out there, Frank. The acorns are big. Have you noticed? Supposedly that means a hard winter, but
it doesn't even look like we're going to have winter. I can't remember if you have acorns inWashington."
"We, do," he said. "If you can find a tree or two."
"Are they big? The acorns, I mean."
"I'll be sure to look, Kay."
I covered my face with my hands and sobbed. He got up from the table and came around to my chair.
Senator Lord and I had grown up inMiamiand had gone to school in the same archdiocese, although I
had attended St. Brendan's High School only one year and long after he was there. Yet that somewhat
removed crossing of paths was a sign of what would come.
When he was the district attorney, I was working for the Dade County Medical Examiner's Office and
often testified in his cases. When he was elected aUnited Statessenator and then appointed the chairman
of the judiciary committee, I was the chief medical examiner ofVirginiaand he began calling on me to lend
my voice in his fight against crime.
I was stunned when he called me yesterday to say he was coming to see me and had something
important to deliver. I barely slept all night. I was devastated when he walked into my kitchen and
slipped the simple white envelope out of a pocket of his suit. .
As I sat with him now, it made perfect sense thatBentonwould have trusted him this much. He knew
Senator Lord cared deeply for me and would never let me down. How typical ofBentonto have a plan
that would be executed perfectly, even though he wasn't around to see it through. How typical of him tó
predict my behavior after his death and for every word of it to be true.
"Kay," Senator Lord said, standing over me as I wept in my chair, "I know how hard this must be and
wish I could make it all go away. I think one of the hardest things I've ever done was promiseBentonI
would do this. I never wanted to believe this day would come, but it has and I'm here for you."
He fell silent, then added, "No one's ever asked me to do anything like this before, and I've been asked
a lot of things."
"He wasn't like other people," I quietly replied as I willed myself to calm down. "You know that, Frank.
Thank God you do."
Senator Lord was a striking man who bore himself with the dignity of his office. He had thick gray hair
and intense blue eyes, was tall and lean and dressed, as was typical, in a conservative dark suit accented
by a bold, bright tie, cuff links, pocket watch and stickpin., I got up from my chair and took a deep,
shaky breath. I snatched several tissues from a box and wiped my face and nose.
"You were very kind to come here," I said to him.
"What else can I do for you?" he replied with a sad smile.
"You've done it all by being here. I can't imagine the trouble you've gone to. Your schedule and all."

"I must admit I flew in fromFlorida, and by the way, I checked on Lucy and she's doing great things
down there," he said.
Lucy, my niece, was an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, or ATF. Recently, she
had been reassigned to theMiamifield office, and I hadn't seen her for months.
"Does she know about the letter?" I asked Senator Lord.
"No," he answered, looking out the window at a perfect day. "I think that's your call to make. And she's
feeling rather neglected by you, I might add."
"By me?" I said, surprised. "She's the one who can't be reached. At least I'm not undercover chasing gun
traffickers and other persons of such fine character. She can't even talk to me unless she's at
headquarters or on a pay phone."
"You're not easy to find, either. You've been elsewhere in your spirit sinceBentondied. Missing in action,
and I don't even think you realize it," he said. "I know. I've tried to reach out to you, too, haven't I?"
Tears flooded my eyes again.
"And if I get hold of you, what do you tell me? Every-thing's fine. Just busy Not to mention, you haven't
come to see me once. Now and then in the old days, you even brought me some of your special soups.
You haven't been taking care of those who love you. You haven't been taking care of yourself."
He had covertly glanced up at the clock several times now. I got up from my chair.
"Are you- heading back toFlorida?" I asked in an unsteady voice.
"Afraid not.Washington," he said. "I'm on Face the Nation again. More of the same. I'm so disgusted by
it all, Kay."
"I wish I could do something to help you," I said to him.
"It's dirty out there, Kay. If certain people knew I was here alone in your house with you, they'd start
some vicious rumor about me. I'm sure of it:'
"I wish you hadn't came here, then.."
"Nothing would have stopped me. And I shouldn't be railing on aboutWashington. You have enough to
deal with."
"I'll vouch for your sterling character anytime," I said.
"It wouldn't do any good, if it came to that."
I walked him through the impeccable house I had designed, past fine furniture and art and the antique
medical instruments I collected, and over bright rugs and hardwood floors. Everything was precisely to
my taste but not at all the same as it had been whenBentonwas here. I paid no more attention to my
home than I did to myself these days. I had become a heartless custodian of my life, and it was evident
everywhere I looked.

Senator Lord noticed my briefcase open on the great room couch, and case files, mail and memos
spilled over the glass coffee table, and legal pads on the floor. Cushions were askew, an ashtray dirty
because I'd started smoking again. He didn't lecture me.
"Kay, do you understand I've got to have limited contact with you after this?" Senator Lord said.
"Because of what I just alluded to."
"God, look at this place," I blurted out in disgust. "I just can't seem to keep up anymore."
"There've been rumors;" he cautiously went on. "I won't go into them. There have been veiled threats."
Anger heated his voice. "Just because we're friends."
"I used to be so neat." I gave a heartbroken laugh. "Benton and I were always squabbling about my
house, my shit. My perfectly appointed, perfectly arranged shit." My voice rose as grief and fury flared
up higher than before. "If he rearranged or put something irt the wrong drawer . . . That's what happens
when you hit middle age and have lived alone and had everything your own goddamn way."
"Kay, are you listening to me? I don't want you to feel I don't care if I don't call you very much, if I don't
invite you up for lunch or to get your advice about some bill I'm trying to pass."
"Right now I can't even remember when Tony and I got divorced," I bitterly said. "What? Nineteen
eighty-three? He left. So what? I didn't need him or anyone else who followed. I could make my world
the way I wanted it, and I did. My career, my possessions, my investments. And look."
I stood still. in the foyer and swept my hand over my beautiful stone house and all that was in it.
"So what? So fucking what?" I looked Senator Lord in the eye. "Bentoncould dump garbage in the
middle of this fucking housel He could tear the goddamn place down! I just wish none of it had ever
mattered, Frank:' I wiped away furious tears. "I wish I could do it over and never criticize him once about
anything. I just want him here. Oh, God, I want him here. Every morning I wake up not remembering,
and then it hits again and I can barely get out of bed."
Tears ran down my face. It seemed every nerve in my body had gone haywire.
"You made Benton very happy," Senator Lord said gently and with feeling. "You meant everything to
him. He told me how good you were to him, how much you understood the hardships of his life, the
awful things he had to see when he was working those atrocious,-cases; for the FBI. Deep down, I
know you know that."
