Correct me if I’m wrong but I think all apartment units in Japan have ofuro (???) or bathtubs. I do like taking hot baths but I never got lucky with the tub of that apartment in Osaka. My friends took advantage of their tubs while my housemates and I avoided using ours. It looked like a stainless deep well and it looked so old! Anyway, if I own a house in the future, I would like to have a bathtub in the master’s bedroom. A 5-foot whirlpool would be more than a luxury since I can’t even afford to buy whirlpool faucets!

I haven’t mentioned this previously but I kind of miss the bathtubs in Japan because bathrooms of the HDB units here in Singapore don’t have tubs. It would have been a lot better if the shower and toilet are separate because I really hate stepping on wet floor every time I brush my teeth.

I love going to the Changi Airport Terminal 3 mainly because it is not crowded. There is this shop called Periwinkle where I often find beautiful dresses for Shaynna that are always on sale! Or I could just bring a good book with me and find a chair in one of the quiet spots. There’s also a food court so I don’t have to eat in its cafes or restaurants and end up paying a lot because of the 10% service charge and 7% GST. Most of all, I love the decorations! Now that it’s Christmas, they put up this really huge inflatable where kids could play for free if you could just present a receipt from the shop(s)…

In about a week, I’ll be on my way home! I planned to do another round of detox before I go home but I had loads to do at work that I had to go there last Saturday. Eating just fruits could definitely make me dizzy, making me less capable of thinking clear. So I canceled the plan. But there’s a lot of holiday feasts ahead of me and I’m getting really worried to ward off extra calories! I have to at least maintain what I’ve accomplished so far. Everyone agrees that the best fat burner is exercise so I have to do it. But how can I motivate myself and my family?

When I browsed through the Facebook updates, I’ve noticed that there’s a fun run (at least 3kms) in my hometown on December 26th. It’s one of the alumni homecoming activities. My brother and I went to the same school and I have to convince him to run with me. I think most of my high school friends have no intention of joining. You see, I don’t want to be too kind to my brother because I don’t want him to treat me like how he treats my mother. It’s a long and painful story… but I gotta do it. It’s the best way for me to combat weight gain. Maybe I’ll be able to convince my mother also. It’s gotta be a fun Christmas vacation!

I’ve changed my moisturizer and night cream about two months ago. The new ones are good at minimizing my acne scars but then the acne breakout in my chin is seriously getting worse! But why only in my chin! I’m pretty sure this is no longer hormonal acne as they are always there even when I’m done with my monthly period. This left me with one possible culprit: my food intake. If my memory serves me right, it started after I ate that Japanese pasta with tiny dried shrimp on it. Followed by chicken on almost every lunch, and that really delicious seafood pasta (with lots of shrimp) I ate a few days back. So starting tomorrow, I should strive to just eat those food that could most likely give me skin problems. I do have a very bad allergic reaction once to shrimp!

A few more days and I’ll be on a plane home! I’m so excited that I’m almost done packing my stuff! But one of the things that I need to consider is the phone that I have to use when I’m in the Philippines. It’s just so sad that it’s not safe to just carelessly use mobile phones even in my hometown. I wonder if I had my mobile phone insured when I got it. If I do have an iPad, I’ll definitely get an ipad insurance! Anyway, I really don’t feel safe using my phone there so I’ll definitely need to borrow my sister’s.

Twenty more days and I’ll be on a plane home. But I find it really funny when the closer you get to that much-anticipated vacation, then you get busier at work! Still, I can’t contain my excitement. I’ll be seeing my daughter again and I already have some activities laid out. Nope, I could not afford to go on a trip so we’ll be spending the Christmas season at home.

Christmas shopping is almost done. All I need is the gift for my mother. Still, I can’t afford to buy her diamond stud earrings or an expensive wrist watch. But she’s easy to please. Just like any other moms, she loves handbags. It doesn’t have to be expensive. Maybe I’ll get her a perfume. The last one she had was when my father went home from abroad for the last time.

How about you? Are you done with your Christmas shopping?
