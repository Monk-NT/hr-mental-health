The meteorological conditions were superb. Unfortunately, the bookish ones were not.

Despite a blizzard providing a perfect excuse to be sequestered indoors and plenty of books on the TBR shelves and Nook, my reading so far this weekend has been abysmal. First, although about a third of the way in, I gave up on Mark Twain’s autobiography. For whatever reason, it just didn’t keep my interest. In fact, despite the fact I started in on Thanksgiving, I read four others books during the roughly two weeks I spent with Twain. I finally just punted. No worries, though, given the books on the TBR shelf by my reading chair and the larger one in the bedroom.

Yet none of them really intrigued me. I picked up and put down at least half a dozen books, never making it more than two pages into any one of them. Still no problem. After all there’s more than 50 ebooks on my Nook (95 percent of which were free from B&N, Project Gutenberg or the new Google ebookstore). I got about 60 pages into Orhan Pamuk’s My Name Is Red. My mind, though, was too unfocused for the multiple narrators and folk tales within the tale. I then switched to…. Bret Easton Ellis’ American Psycho. Only in retrospect did I realize that leap suggested just how nebulous my reading interests are.

But it isn’t necessarily a barometric state. It’s something I’ve been dealing with for a week. Perhaps the idea of reading what I want when I want is too freeing. And I’m guessing that before the day is out, I will have abandoned Ellis for another author. In fact, I checked out an ebook from the public library this morning — and even now am contemplating a jaunt to the library to return some books and see if anything grabs me as I wander amongst the shelves.


Something that had been in the back a my mind for a while really started to sink in with last week’s announcement of the Grammy nominees — age is not only staring me in the face, it is slapping it.

Ever since this blog started, I’ve had an annual post on my record of the year. I even have a 10-year list. I began pondering this year’s selection a while ago — and kept coming up blank. Now the Grammy nominations and a few other lists suggest that I am falling too far behind on music to catch up againt.

I may have heard a cut or two off Arcade Fire’s The Suburbs but, to my knowledge, that’s the closest I’ve come to hearing a note from any of the Album of the Year nominees. I don’t do much better in other categories. In the jazz area, the only one I have is the Dave Holland Octet’s Pathways, nominated for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album. In the rock and pop areas, the only albums I’ve heard are Neil Young’s Le Noise (Best Rock Album nominee) and Singularity, the album by former Doors guitarist Robbie Krieger nominated for Best Pop Instrumental Album. I was not really impressed by either.

Now the Grammys aren’t a lodestar of musical excellence. In fact, Arcade Fire’s presence on the list seems to go a bit contrary to the commercial nature of the awards. Still, the nominations aren’t the only thing showing my musical tastes have become too aged.

For example, while it covers a very broad range of music, I haven’t heard a single album on NPR Music’s 50 favorite albums of 2010. I have one album on Paste Magazine’s 50 best albums of 2010, Bruce Springsteen’s The Promise. While the set of previously unreleased songs from the Darkness on the Edge of Town recording sessions is at number 12, I haven’t even heard any of the other 49 releases on the list. Similarly, the highest-ranking album I’ve heard on Amazon’s best albums of 2010 is number 22, David Cross’ Bigger and Blackerer — a comedy album. The only other one I’ve heard in the top 50 is Corinne Bailey Rae’s The Sea in position 27.

It perhaps shouldn’t be surprising. I quit listening to Top 40 radio in the mid- to late 1970s and I’ve never enjoyed rap or hip hop. That alone drastically reduces the scope and variety of what I hear. Still, nothing I heard this year really grabbed me. I can only hope that is a reflection of what was released this year. After all, being old is one thing — being old without hope is far more serious.


As the past month or so has indicated, I’ve been somewhat uninspired when it comes to writing original posts. It’s not that there aren’t ideas on paper and in my head but, as Hugh Prather said, “If the desire to write is not accompanied by actual writing, then the desire must be not to write.”

One third of the posts last month were book reviews. There will even be a temporary lull in those, though, because there are maybe two books I’ll need to review between now and year-end. It’s something I’m actually looking forward to and, in fact, I passed on a half dozen or so books to create the time for that respite.

As I’ve said before, I find there’s a difference between reading a book for review and simply reading a book. I also think that there’s a seasonal element to not wanting to read for review this time of year. I feel I just want to kick back and read for sheer enjoyment, to hopefully get lost in a book. It isn’t that I don’t enjoy reading for review purposes. I think my aging brain gets a little weary near the end of each year.

So for the next four weeks or so I plan to read what I want when I want. If I want to put a book down to start another one, it will be without worrying about having time to write a timely review. Equally important, I can spend as much time as I want doing what I’ve long called “reading with my eyes closed.”
