As most of my longtime blogging buddies know, I usually take a break around this time because my work hours increase dramatically and a day off becomes non-existent.

I’m coming upon an 11-day marathon where I need to focus all my mental and physical energy on work.

After today my time online will be limited, however I will post once again before Christmas day to wish all of you a Merry Christmas.

Please know that I will sincerely be thinking of you guys and gals and missing you; hoping you’re enjoying this holiday season and celebrating yours.

I would like to leave you with a short video clip from one of my favorite Christmas movies….White Christmas.

There is a scene in the film where Betty (Rosemary Clooney) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) do a flawless number from their sister act called, “Sisters.”

Every time I watch them perform this number, I can’t help but wish I owned one of those faaaaaabulous blue feathered fans, so I could reenact the number in the privacy of my own apartment while drinking a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon.

Things look so much prettier with wine, don’ t they?

What can I tell ya….twirling a blue feathered fan to this gay man is like experiencing a wet dream.

But since I can‘t call designer Bob Mackie and ask him to whip up one of those flawless fans for me, the next best thing would be watching Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye do it for me.

So, allow me to share “Sisters.”

You GO, boys!


I would like to quickly reiterate for those of you who may be new to my blog, by saying that the wonderful lady you often hear me refer to as my mother, is actually my stepmother. However, I will always think of her as my mother because she has lovely nurtured me since I was 8 years old.

Tuesday evening, I was looking through some old family photographs and came across several images of my birth mother.

You can read more about her here.

Quite often, people will ask me if I remember her because I was so young when she died. And it’s strange, because I can’t say that I actually remember specific moments with her, however I do remember feeling how strong our bond was.

I was the youngest of my mothers three children, and it was only a matter of six years after giving birth to me that she passed away.

She was 40 years old.

My father in his later years, often told me how close I was to my mother. He said that when I was a little boy, I would be outside playing, and then suddenly run into our house to check in on her; making sure she was okay.

And even though I had no idea she was ill, I must have sensed something because I was apparently always worried about her. My father said that I was forever touching her; hugging her. As if to protect her.

I guess the main thing I remember about my mother is that she seemed like an angel to me.

Ethereal. Delicate and refined.

Pure.

A gentle soul. Soft-spoken.

I never remember her expressing anger of any kind. In fact, I never remember hearing her raise her voice, even once.

It’s odd to think that I was so close to her, yet cannot remember one single moment we shared with one another.

Throughout these many passing years, periodically I’ve tried to squeeze my brain; hoping to recall something.

Yet, never have.

But what I can recall is the love we shared.

No words. No remembered experiences. Only the bond of love.

And even to this day, I still feel that love.

Holding me. Guiding me. Like a whisper.

Like an angel.



I’ve often shared with you in past blog posts of how much I genuinely love my job. Even with the bitching and moaning I sometimes do about working with the public, and dealing with the tremendous amount of competitiveness in this industry, I have such a passion for offering the public what it is that I sell.

Allow me say first and foremost, that in order for me to sell something I have to have pride in it. Believe in it. Because if I don’t, I truthfully can’t sell it. If I don’t ‘feel’ it, I can’t make someone else feel it.

The company I work for does everything first class, or they don’t do it all.

They are a company who creates their product without worrying whether the public is going to embrace it. They don’t go after the public, they have a way of making the public come after them. And they do this because they create what THEY love, and just assume the public will.

And it does.

The product I represent has a strong following. It may not be as large as some of the other companies in this industry, but it has a loyal following. People who will only use this product.

People who will wait patiently, until this company creates something new.

One of the things I most admire about my company, is that they don’t create new products in a massive hurry. They may only create something new, once or twice a year. They don’t flood the market with too much, so their product remain rare and precious.

They allow the public to want them.

They are also a company who donates a percentage of their sales to various charities throughout the year.

They graciously distribute their success and wealth.

The economy as we all know right now, is not very grand. So selling times are tough, like with most businesses. Therefore, as I’ve shared with you before, my company had to cut back on my hours last Spring. But I can’t say that I was angry or upset with them for doing so, because I knew it would eventually happen. However, the manner in which they did it was very professional and with TLC. I can honestly say, they genuinely care about their employees.

My boss, the person I take my direction from, is someone I also admire and respect. She’s a hard worker. And she’s smart, because she trusts me enough to sell in the manner in which I do (softy), and has faith that I will produce what needs to be produced each year. She never hounds or rides me in any way, she just let’s me be.

Is my job always perfect? No, of course not. Who’s job is?

Yes, I love my company, but I don't always love the industry.

However, right now I’m grateful to have a job, and with a company who strives to give it their best.

Not a whole hell of a lot of people can say they love and have great pride in the company they work for for the past 5 1 years.

But, I can.

And I’m so happy about that, because it makes me feel more passionate about going to work.

Thank you, company!
