
One of the reasons that there has been a slight lack of blog posts recently is that the Girlie and have been rather busy working on a couple of big projects.
One of these is the re-design and re-launch of our Links sites.
These are a series of regional sites where people can advertise their businesses for free and also use the automated Classified Ads system (once again – it’s totally free!)
There’s also the facility for blog owners to have their own blogs featured on the site!
If any of this interests you, I’d suggest that you take a look at your nearest Links site (there are 16 to choose from – and more coming soon!)

We’ve set all the sites up so that you can get Tweets (Twitter is perfect for this sort of site) every time someone adds a new classified ad (never again miss that bargain!)
The Girlie also gets loads of emails about special offers from suppliers who deliver to France.
She is going to be selecting the best for you and posting details on each of the sites.
Oh, did I mention that there’s also a Shopping Center where we list shops that deliver to France?
So, if you want to find out what we have been up to…
Why not take a stroll to your nearest Links Site….
And have a look around.

I’m sorry for the slight lack of posts over the last couple of weeks.
I’ve been having a few sleep related issues due to the cold weather and the Girlie and I have been very busy on two new projects (details of which will be announced in the next few days.)
But, I’m happy to say that all is back on track and normal service has been resumed (although what passes for normal here might be considered obscenely abnormal in most decent and respectable households!)
And, just to prove it, here’s a nice picture of a spider’s web!

I don’t often talk about the FourteenYearOld but I had these photos lying around and thought I’d use them.
So, for any fans of the FourteenYearOld, here are some photos…
Any susceptible young girlies in the audience might want to look away…
The above photo details the Step-Son (otherwise known as the FourteenYearOld) being rather photogenic…

I do have to admit…
Without hesitation and in full public view…
In full knowledge that I shall be measured by my words…

That I Bluddy luuuurve my chickies!…
They lay double yokers just for me…
That taste like the best eggy peggies in the world!


A busy week has seen me doing lots of that social meeting people type stuff!
In the previous post, Spanish guests, I detailed Thursday and Friday night’s entertainment.
On the Saturday night, the Girlie drove us down south to St. Gildas des Bois to visit Trevor and Charlie who have a holiday home there.
It’s non-stop; this constant whirl of social events in sleepy southern Brittany!



 	

 
As you can see, they were excellent hosts, keeping us well supplied with red wine and cream cakes!
After an enjoyable barbeque, it was nice to sit and talk whilst Joshy kept himself busy on the Nintendo Wii!
Must ask Father Christmas to reserve a Nintendo Wii for me!!!
And then, after three social occasions in three days….
The Girlie persuaded me to come and talk to her gardening club!
They have a website here…. www.BrittanyGardenersClub.com
It wasn’t quite as frightening as I thought it might be!
And the home made scones and jam were delicious!
The pictures here are of the peaches and apples in the back garden at La Coudrais.
As we’ve got my neice, Martha, staying for a few days, we might have to see what is in the garden that we can pick.
Meanwhile – back in the real world, www.KeithEckstein.com and www.BrittanyWebsites.com seem to be picking up visitors so it all seems good for the start of my new enterprise.
Below are some of the photos we have taken.

We’ve had some guests from Barcelona staying in the end Gite.
Xavier and Theresa (and their two daughters Bertha and Clara) seeemed to have an enjoyable time and the weather behaved itself during their stay.
In fact, they seemed so happy that they invited the Girlie, Joshy and me out for a meal last Friday, to say thanks.
I didn’t like to mention that the good weather wasn’t all down to me!


 	

 
So, on the Friday evening we all trouped off to L’Abricotier in La Gacilly to destroy a few pizzas!
L’Abricotier is a great little restaurant that’s been open since 1993. As well as having a great range of Pizzas, they also do pasta, salads, fish and meat dishes and curries!
The Girlie and I both went for a Chicken Biriani but, I have to admit helping Joshy finish his Pizza!
His fault really for choosing a Pizza the size of Basingstoke!
The next evening (and their last evening here), our guests came over for a glass of wine.
Xavier and I quickly found some common ground, in a typically male manner – football!
But we did manage to contribute to the rest of the conversation!
Joshy kept the girls entertained until it was their bedtimes!
He’s even learnt a few words of Spanish!
It’s so nice when our guests have a good time here.
Especially if the weather behaves.
The Girlie and I are looking forward to seeing Xavier and Teresa again.
Perhaps visiting them in Barcelona!
It’ll have to be timed to coincide with some footie, though!
Below are some of the photos we have taken.


A successful week – even though it’s only Wednesday!
On Monday I visited the work’s doctor who declared that I was a danger to myself and my colleagues and that I wouldn’t be able to return to work. Not only that, but… I was so dangerous that there was no point in having a second visit to make sure – he’d sign me off straight away.
And, just to make sure, he’d write a letter to me explaining all that!
Now, that was nice, wasn’t it?


 	

 
So, finally, I shall be leaving Helga’s House of Pain – as we call the Abattoir from Hell where, I have to admit, I have spent six and a half very happy years.
It really is good news as now I’ll be free to fix computers and do web design in Brittany – now, that’ll make a change from little bits of dead pig!
There was another cause for celebration, though….
Four months ago I changed the drive belt on the Girlie’s sit on mower.
I did a good job of it – really, I did!
Unfortunately, the mower hasn’t worked since!
Just a coincidence – really!
Having watched me replace the drive belt, the starter motor decided to give up the ghost.
We found out that a new starter motor from the lawnmower shop would cost the Girlie one of her kidneys (and then some) – and the Girlie wasn’t so keen on the operation.
So we tried to source a starter motor from ebay and local sites.
Many false starts and shattered hopes but… no joy.
So, we gave in and ordered one from America.
It arrived about twenty minutes later and cost the same as a cup of tea!
I fitted it (without breaking anything else) and the Girlie and I tried out the lawnmower in the sweltering heat!
And finally, just cos they’re pretty, a picture of Girlie’s flowers.
I do apologise for that first photo!
I really do have a belly the size of the Isle of Wight!
Meanwhile – back in the real world, I have applied for my Siret number and I have updated - www.KeithEckstein.comwhere I detail the services that I shall be offering.
If anyone reading this has a Blogger Blog, you might want to take a look at www.Favicons4Free.com for free (and easy to use), Favcions.
Back to reality now. Below are some of the photos we have taken.
