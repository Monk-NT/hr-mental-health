One of the reasons that there has been a slight lack of blog posts recently is that the Girlie and have been rather busy working on a couple of big projects.
One of these is the re-design and re-launch of our Links sites.
These are a series of regional sites where people can advertise their businesses for free and also use the automated Classified Ads system (once again – it’s totally free!)
There’s also the facility for blog owners to have their own blogs featured on the site!
If any of this interests you, I’d suggest that you take a look at your nearest Links site (there are 16 to choose from – and more coming soon!)

We’ve set all the sites up so that you can get Tweets (Twitter is perfect for this sort of site) every time someone adds a new classified ad (never again miss that bargain!)
The Girlie also gets loads of emails about special offers from suppliers who deliver to France.
She is going to be selecting the best for you and posting details on each of the sites.
Oh, did I mention that there’s also a Shopping Center where we list shops that deliver to France?
So, if you want to find out what we have been up to…
Why not take a stroll to your nearest Links Site….
And have a look around.

I’m sorry for the slight lack of posts over the last couple of weeks.
I’ve been having a few sleep related issues due to the cold weather and the Girlie and I have been very busy on two new projects (details of which will be announced in the next few days.)
But, I’m happy to say that all is back on track and normal service has been resumed (although what passes for normal here might be considered obscenely abnormal in most decent and respectable households!)
And, just to prove it, here’s a nice picture of a spider’s web!

I don’t often talk about the FourteenYearOld but I had these photos lying around and thought I’d use them.
So, for any fans of the FourteenYearOld, here are some photos…
Any susceptible young girlies in the audience might want to look away…
The above photo details the Step-Son (otherwise known as the FourteenYearOld) being rather photogenic…

I do have to admit…
Without hesitation and in full public view…
In full knowledge that I shall be measured by my words…

That I Bluddy luuuurve my chickies!…
They lay double yokers just for me…
That taste like the best eggy peggies in the world!
