he first time was when "Salamat Dok" (Thank You Doc) needed Dentistry students for a medical-dental mission, and a couple of my classmates and I were chosen to go. This is quite insignificant, though; Bon said I just came on screen a few milliseconds or so, and the only reason why he knew it was me was because I was wearing my scrub suit and it was printed.
The second time was when I was an associate at Zen Dental Spa/Lapid Dental Center and we got featured at "News on Q". I had no speaking parts. It was my boss' time to shine but she chose me to be the dentist who pretended to be treating the patient. I totally regret this because my hair got in the way (hahahahaha!).
I am going to be on television, for real, this time. Last week, I received a call from a representative of Dentiste'  nighttime toothpaste, and she asked if it was okay for me to do an interview with them.

Me: Regarding what?
Dentiste': Well, it's just going to be about oral hygiene...
Me: I guess it's okay
Dentiste': But Doc, this is going to be on television, at "Umagang Kay Ganda"
Me: Oh, wait...
Dentiste': Don't worry it's going to be a short one. The whole segment will just run for two minutes. Initially they were planning to invite a dentist to do a live interview, but now they will come to you, so they will shoot in the clinic
Me: Oh wow! That's really nice!
Dentiste': So do you think you can do it?
Me: Are they going to interview other dentists too?
Dentiste': No Doc, just you...
Me: Oh no!

I paused for about 10 seconds and I thought: "Crickette you are going to be on television and "You and Your Teeth" will be featured , as well. Plus, it's a morning show... everyone's still asleep!" And then I spoke again...

Me: Okay! I'll do it!
Dentiste': Is it okay if I drop by the clinic to discuss the whole thing?
Me: Yes please, that'd be nice...

Days before the shoot, I was both excited and scared. I was worried about how I'd look on television and how I'd sound. I wasn't so worried about what I'd say because it wasn't going to be live and if I say something stupid, they can easily edit it out. Also, the whole segment is not about me. It is about this brand...

  

Dentiste' is a nighttime toothpaste and their target market are couples. It is herbal and in contains 14 natural extracts, as well as these four very important components:
Xylitol: which is a natural sweetener that is known to neutralize the pH of saliva and fights tooth decay, plaque as bad breath
CDX (Cyclodextrin): doughnut shaped molecules that eliminate odors like cigarette smoke, alcohol and bad morning breath
Micronized Silica Complex: a grinding ingredient that soothes sensitive teeth
Stable Vitamin C: that keep the gums healthy and restores destroyed collagen fibers
No, I am not an endorser, but since I was going to appear on television I thought it best to really study the material (in case). 



This is "Missy" but you are free to change her name if you buy her. She is very playful and very sweet. I took this picture at night, so she is messy already (as they usually take a bath in the morning). She is not difficult to have (but I’d have to warn you she loved to play with people’s feet) and the other night, I let her sleep on my bed and she just positioned herself at the bottom of the bed (and did not "pee" or "poop"). 

She has no particular breed because our dogs are sluts and they just have affairs with each other. She is 1/4 shitzhu, 1/4 poodle, 1/2 japanese spitz. I will show you her parents and her granddad, okay? 



That's our Gudoy, but he's gone now.
He's a poodle and once upon a time, he had "sex" with a neighbor shitzhu and they produced...

  

Choco. Choco is super lovely.
All her babies are sweet and chubby and she is the smartest dog that we have.
Sadly, dogs will be dogs, so she had "sex" with...

  

Hugo. Hugo is a japanese spitz and I don't really like him but my mom and sister does.

Don't get confused: GUDOY is the grandpa and CHOCO and HUGO are MISSY's parents. If you wanna buy her, leave me your email address and we can talk business. She is really cheap. Okay, I'll tell you the price already: P3,000. Maybe we can still do something about the price... but I'm not gonna promise, okay?


hi. i am crickette inserto and i am a dentist by profession. before taking my oath as a dental practitioner, writing was and, still is, my first love and being a drama queen is something that i am truly known for. the drama queen can tell stories, is my second blog. back in 2004, i maintained a blog (here in blogger, as well) but i somehow lost access to that. clinical duties and the rigors of my course, forced me to lose interest in blogging and writing altogether until finally, in late 2008, i decided to tell stories again. 

i write because writing placates me. it is a perfect venue for me to pour out my thoughts and emotions. this blog is nothing more than just an expression of who i truly am as a person and my stories, although they may be trivial to some, are based on actual truths. people who know me, know that this is who i am. and for those who wish to find out more about me... go ahead.

i have once been told that i was "toxic", but i see it as just me being true to who i am, and i can get quite obsessive. i don't shy away from challenges and i am not afraid to speak my mind. i face problems head on, so i collide with struggles with much frequency. nevertheless, who i am as a person, is based on the the things i went through in my life. you will observe that i tend to speak my mind as much in this blog, but i try my best not to offend anybody (but every once in a while, fail). if i end up poking a sensitive bone, understand that i am a "nobody", and my existence in the web is rather insignificant. 

once again, i am crickette inserto --- and i am dentist who is constantly online waiting for patients to arrive. this is my personal niche in the web... WELCOME!
