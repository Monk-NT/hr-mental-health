You better cool it in there or they're going to drop you and you won’t
be able to insure anything," Sophie calls out. “But you won’t believe
this!" “Sure I will." “Look, the people in New York who always
insure the loft are offering to insure both the loft on the Bowery again,
which they've never seen, and now the farm too, which they will not
even get around to looking at for a month or two.’ ‘So, let ‘em. " “But
I could be living up here in a comcrib and playing with matches." “Let
‘em, their price is better." “No, what I want is for my insurer up here
to give in and cover both places. They're real, they're local, I’ve dealt
with them for years."
“You're not going to much longer if you don't leave that woman
alone." “All I said was didn’t she think it was outrageous that an artist's
studio can't get insurance, didn't that constitute discrimination?" “She
is not interested in answering that sort of question.” “She won’t answer
anything, just this same old jazz all the time about the head office. So
I gave her Mom's line about complaining to the commissioner of insurance for the State of New York. Let's see what she says this time
this must be her calling back."
And it is. She will give me liability insurance for the loft; the head
office has relented, reconsidered, made an exception, looked up a ruling
or whatever it does. And the price is right too; I knew I’d get a better rate
if I hung on. I have saved three hundred dollars, real live money to run
the farm on. “It has taken you all aftemoon to do this - why don’t you
go swimming now?" Sophie says.
Alas, there are still all the bills to pay and the checks to write. Writing
in the confusion of entry and exit from the three rooms that give onto
this one, the sounds of the kitchen, the radio and the phonograph ac-
companying apprentice labor on the next set of French windows, which
are being dressed down with paint remover on the front lawn, bits of
yellow paint and the vicious chemical that has dissolved it now mixed
with bits of grass and tracked over the front porch. From my desk in the
front hall I must apprehend each feet set of tennis shoes seeking lem-
onade or the toilet, or they will track this gunk over the rugs as well.
And these two Persian rugs happen to be my treasure, paid for with the
first big show I ever had in Califomia; imagining I had eamed twice the
money I actually did, I took it right over to Omar Khayyam, my man in
Berkeley, and spent seven hours buying two rugs. I am livid at the
prospect of their being harmed, insisting. pleading, begging—
whatever—that they be seen not as bourgeois objects to be despised and
disrespected but as works of art women have made over months of time.
underpaid and unrecognized. “You would not track paint remover over
a canvas, would you?" “No.” The bored look; they have heard about
these rugs so damn many times. Because, of course, I am at their mercy,
they must know it by now; their malice, conscious or unconscious,
could destroy anything in this house and I would still be forced to play
the good hostess and say that's all right, don’t worry about it. Today it’s
all too much for me; whenever I'm on the phone someone comes in
wanting me to write a check to H. G. Page, our building supply, for
turpentine or sixpenny nails, and where are the car keys? While writing
the check I am interrupted by four other issues: Where are the screw-
drivers? “Where they always are." “We can't find them." “Do you
want me to go find them for you?" "Yeah." Then it's the saw, then it’s
shall we take the fittings off the doors? “Yes, would you put them in an
envelope so they won’! get lost?" “Where is an envelope?” I am still
writing the check I began ten minutes ago. And look down to find that
I have miswritten it. And explode.
I sit by the pond feeling like an awful person, one who explodes. Now
you have made the apprentices hate you. They will see you as a bully for
blowing up and shouting at them, they will never understand how im-
possible it has been to concentrate for the last two hours, for days now.
Because you have made bad arrangements, you can't work at a desk in
the middle of a traffic pattem that involves all those rooms: living room,
dining room, front porch, the staircase up to the second floor — Grand
Central Station. Maybe you should move over to the cottage next door,
the oldest section of the farmhouse; no one uses the ground floor there.
Maybe you could have a real office, get something done, have room for
all those files spilling around on the floor.
But I have alienated them. When I wanted to be their friend, see the
light of admiration in their eyes. lt is so easy to go from big sister to old
bag. I too am a little sister, I know what it's like. Sitting by the pond and
nursing the wounds of big and little sisters, l decide to give my own big
sister a call. Elder, the Lawyer out in Nebraska. I’ll tell her about my
insurance difficulties; I'll amuse her with this geometric proof that when
they refused to insure my loft because it's an art studio l got the goods
on a giant corporation and material for a theoretical little case of dis-
crimination.
“Hi, Sally, I have the funniest thing to tell you. How's this for a new
civil rights angle—how about artists—would you believe that the insur-
ance business won’t touch an artist’s studio for theft or fire?" ‘ ‘Are you
taking your medicine?" What the hell does this have to do with any-
thing? I wonder. Though it is not the first time I’ve called her or Mother
with some joke or something to crow over and been hit in the face with
this inquiry. “Yeah. Are you interested in what I have to say?" But the
fun has gone out of it; in fact this moment has been like being a child
again and getting slapped. And however bravely I claw back to the adult
leve1——my self-conscious attempt to play amateur legalist to her actual
prairie lawyer—l cannot manage it. Her voice is steely with patience:
“Are you taking your lithium?”
Suddenly it all comes back, the last time, the loony-bin trip, the
shame, the terror of being locked up. It was she who put me there—a
thing I can forgive but not quite forget, though it was forgotten until the
line: “Are you taking your medicine?" like a bullying sergeant, like an
order, like a prison guard in those prisons I thought I had left forever.
I realize that if she were to know I have gone off the stuff, she might be
out here in no time, might even have me busted with a few phone calls.
Meaning well—they always mean well. And they always win: by the
time you are busted you are crazy, certified and incompetent, marked to
the extent of having a record. broken by the bust and, when the depres-
sion comes down, contrite and crumpled and only too willing to crawl
to the psychiatrists, take what they will give you; the arrival of depression proving you were manic too at the moment when they comered
you.
l will not be comered again. This call was a mistake. the wrong
number. the very opposite of what I want to evoke. lt was hubris to have
done this; I've opened the very doors of my doom. What false and
self-defeating impulse was this?—you can never prove anything here.
“You're getting out of line," she says. “Sally, really . .  “ls Sophie
there?” ls Sophie a guard, a keeper of sanity? “She's outside, probably
having a go in that little boat of hers out on the pond.” “What?” As if
the little boat were proof of hallucination. Speaking up, l say: “We have
a little plastic boat here. Sophie’s afraid of the pond because of the
leeches. She insists on sitting in her boat. “ "Listen. are you taking your
medicine?"
Should l lie? Or should l tell her of the experiment? How Sophie is
pan of it, how we will stop if anything goes wrong, how there’s a doctor
in the neighborhood who is doing tests, will check for any damage the
drug may have done, and can be relied on if something is wrong; failing
that, there is Foreman, the lithium doctor, if I have to go back on it. lt
is over six weeks now and we perceive no ill effects at all. So why
involve Sal in this?
