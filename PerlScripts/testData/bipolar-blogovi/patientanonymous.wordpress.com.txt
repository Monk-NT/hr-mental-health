It is truth and not rumour, that I have been discharged from the Funny Farm.  That was on Tuesday.  However, things have been far from relaxing and peaceful.  Quite the opposite! To the nth degree of opposite, if we could have degrees of opposites! I will refrain from boring you with that minutiae, however.  I will only continue to bore you with this post.

Sometimes you just gotta crash.  So, there I was, laying in my bed, thinking: ‘What can I do to make myself happy?’

Alright.  First, am I unhappy? *pauses*  I don’t know.  I could be.  In fact, I could be a lot of things, but I can’t tell.  The only thing I can tell, is that I’m bloody exhausted! I think I can probably tell that’s why I can’t tell how I feel. *nods*

But forget me being too tired to know what’s going on.  Let’s say I did.  Let’s say you did.  Fine.  We’re all laying about, going crashy-crashy for whatever reason.  Feeling in whatever state we feel.  Why then, is that eternal question asked? “What can I do to make myself happy?”

I’ve got a good answer.  NOTHING.  I’m serious! What is wrong with going crashy-crashy and feeling whatever the hell it is your feeling? Even if it totally sucks? Why do we have to be both “Happiness Dealers” standing on seedy street corners, waiting for the other half of us, the “Happiness Junkies.”

Don’t get me wrong.  I’m not “selling” or “pushing” the idea that we all mope around, or start throwing fits, or whatever suits your particular feeling.  There are just times when I think we don’t deal with them so well.  We avoid them too often when they need to be acknowledged.  Especially when it gets ugly for us.  When it hurts, when it’s scary, so many other things like that.

It may take practise.  A lot of it.  No doubt.  We may need to try and kick our “Happy Habits.”  We may also need to try and learn not to let things get too out of hand, as well.  Either way, learning to just sit–even for a brief period–with our feelings is worth it.  You’ll reap the reward in the long run.


Oh, dear.  I won’t even link to it.  It’s taken me hours to get through it in my obscenely, cognitively impaired state.  It’s pretty huge, anyway.  Yep.  The NCSE! That’s Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus if you haven’t seen it on my blog.

Wow.  Neurology’s tough to figure, but oh my god.  I really want to throw up now.  And not just because of my “regular” post-“ick”tal© signs and symptoms.  From what I just read, I think I want to cry now, too.  Although, maybe it’s still good I figured it out? Maybe it can still be controlled? This massive paper that is SO on target.  Oh, holy hell.  The guy even has a syndrome named after him.  Huh?

I’m not post-“ick”tal© at all.  I mean, well, hang on.  Bear with me as apparently I’m kind of on the extreme end of things.  That’s why I get so messed up when it all happens.  I sort of knew that already, though.  It’s all been so muddled in my head (literally haha!) The NCSE is so muddled, too.

Well, I don’t think I need to bother looking at the calendar anymore.  Tracking my cycle seems pretty irrelevant, now.

Typical absence status epilepticus. It’s actually listed: Catamenial onset.  Prior to finding this, everywhere I was going earlier? Confirmed.  Seizures all over the place regarding periods, ovulation, peri-, post-…hey, anytime estrogen, progesterone and so many other hormones decide bounce around!

Back to the paper.  There’s more!

Some things may have a lesser presentation (my myoclonic leg jerking) and some that he doesn’t mention at all (my motor impairment that can get kinda crazy at times.)  Hello, Wonder Cane and his brother! Maybe really for safety so I don’t friggin’ bang into something and fall.  I get so dizzy I become a freakazoid, klutzy nightmare.  I don’t have any muscle weakness, though.  That’s the (non-)presentation.

Past history of absence seizures? Ah, who the hell knows? Nobody paid attention when I told them about my Simple partials when I was six-years-old! Maybe I had absence seizures, too!

It can also start when I wake up.  Check! Other seizures have occurred prior in life.  Check! Idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  Oh, sure.  Check! I don’t think anyone knows what to call it anymore!

So.  The Boo Hoo News? Well, apart from it totally sucking, how do we deal with this beast?

HRT has been suggested by other people in the epilepsy world for catamenial seizures but please! They found out pretty quickly that monkeying around with hormones just made things worse! Uh, yeah.

Let’s head back to proper treatment of epilepsy.  I was heading in the direction of my Clobazam/Frisium which is good for catamenial stuff, but maybe not if now we’ve drilled down to absence seizures? Still, maybe worth a shot.  A biggie for absence seizures is good ol’ Depakote/Sodium Valproate.  This is a Good News/Bad News/Who Knows What News.  Also, another damn med?

Good News: It might work nicely with my Lamictal/Lamotrigine.  Depakote takes Lamictal and shoots it to the moon (and eventually) back.  Check this.  My Lamictal elimination half life would go from 26hrs to 70hrs! But a baby dose of the Depakote? Because the Lamictal has shut down basically everything! It’s just this damn NCSE!

Bad News/Who Knows What News: Depakote and my Topamax/Topiramate! I could get into some funky hypothermia, hyperammonemia (too much ammonia in my blood) uh…okay.  Again, baby dose? Depakote can be a pain in the arse, anyway, as sometimes you may need blood draws.  Still, baby dose?

Keppra? Oh, enough.  And yes, I called Non-Arsey Neuro.  Appt. booked.
