I know it's been four months since I last posted--and I'd never planned on being away so long--but I am on my way to coming back to this site. It'll likely be next week before I am back up to speed as I am trying to work six months of 90-hour weeks (no, I'm not exaggerating) out of my body. Suffice to say that running an all-volunteer initiative campaign in signature gathering phase is very tough work. The short story is the I-1068 campaign faced just about every obstacle you could imagine and some I never would've guessed at until they happened and we came up short on signatures. The main impediment was the weather: It was a very wet May and June (June was at 200 percent of normal rainfall) this year and that makes it extremely difficult to turn out volunteers to collect signatures. The initiatives that will qualify for this November's ballot in Washington State all relied upon paid signature gatherers. Some initiative backers will spend close to $1 million just on signature gathering. I-1068 spent around $40,000.

Sensible Washington--the group I co-founded earlier this year--is already hatching plans to take another run next year at signature gathering for what I call "Son of I-1068." So the next six months or so ought to be interesting as we ramp up for that. And pray for better weather. And more money.

I've appreciated the many kind sentiments that have come my way the last few months, especially this yesterday from PsychCentral's John Grohol.

It's interesting to be coming back just as the Avandia saga comes to a head and just as GlaxoSmithKline takes a $2.3 billion charge to settle various legal cases connected to Avandia and Paxil. Same as it ever was.


I apologize for being silent for a couple of days on here, but I've been working 12 to 14 hour days--weekends included--since early January and my brain has turned to mush. Why so much work? Let's just say that over the last few weeks I've developed a rich appreciation for something conservatives and small business groups have told me during my reporting career: "There's too much red tape and bureaucratic nonsense involved in starting and running small businesses. It's an economic disincentive."

I'd thought for years that they were overstating the case for political reasons. I don't think that way anymore. There is far too much red tape and far too many hoops to jump through in starting a small organization of any kind--even one like Sensible Washington, which as a PAC is exempt from many reporting requirements--for many people to give it a go. Government red tape, bank red tape, etc., etc., and on and on it goes. It becomes mind numbing after a while.

I hope some time this weekend to pen a few posts, but for now my body and mind are screaming for rest. And less red tape.


Thanks for all the kind queries about my situation. I'm fine. I've simply been overwhelmed with work--volunteer basis, mind you--ever since co-authoring the marijuana law reform initiative for Washington State on January 11. My days have been 12 to 14 hours. That's what it takes to begin the necessary organizational work on such a campaign. I cannot even begin to describe how much heavy lifting is involved.

I expect to be back to a more normal volume of posts fairly soon. I appreciate everyone's understanding.


The murder case against the parents of Rebecca Riley--the 4-year-old with alleged child bipolar disorder who died from an overdose of psych meds in December 2006--has become two murder cases because a Massachusetts court has decided to try the parents separately. Carolyn Riley's case--she's hte mother of course--will begin on Tuesday. There's no date set right now for the trial of Rebecca's father Michael Riley.

I still have a hard time buying murder charges against either parent, but for them to have been jailed pre-trial does tell me a judge thought the evidence against them was compelling. That said, I still don't see a jury conviction for murder and given the dicey nature of medication use in small children and how imprecise and unresearched such psych med use is, if the jury has any sophistication they won't get to a murder conviction. Perhaps a lesser-included charge such an involuntary manslaughter.
