It's odd because normally when my depression hits I want to write, I need to write. This time, however, I seem to be at a lose for words. They all play out in my mind, but I go blank when it comes to write them down. I know that I am not in a good space right now. I will be looking for a counselor again. As my FIL fights his cancer, I battle the demons in my mind...BPD is sneaking its way into my life. I can hear it and feel it. I am so tired and I have no idea how to deal with everything that is going on. I'm falling-fast. My Hubby needs me to be a rock and I start to fall apart; typical me.

I know that I am being selfish and that my thoughts are misplaced, but the energy to shut them up is impossible. I don't want to shut Hubby out, but at the same time I don't want him to see how evil and selfish my thoughts are. I know that they are wrong and I need to sort them out before we have a truly in depth conversation. In the same token he isn't used to me being quite. I try to explain and everything comes out wrong or he tries to interrupt me when I just need him to listen. I start by telling him that I am being irrational and I know, but he's asked me to explain my world and I will try if he just listens. It of course always back fires. Too many tears lately. Tears alone can be draining. For the first time in years I've wondered what it would be like to just run...escape everything...Hubby and kids included. I think I feel alone and I fear my own thoughts. In some strange way running seems safer than staying.

BPD - fear of rejection and abandonment - two issues that are huge for me right now. I think issues that are huge for anyone dealing with death, but harder someone who struggles with them on a daily basis. I tried to stand-up for my Hubby and what he thought he wanted. In the end it led to me being the scapegoat. I was left to hang and dry. I was in my mind rejected and abandoned. Add to that the fact that Hubby has shut me out even more, who knew that was possible, and it gets worse. Small things that people are saying and my mind twists and turns them into all types of monsters. I need to push them aside and be there for my Hubby. I need to be strong for him. I just wish that it wasn't such a battle. I guess that he must struggle with his own battles daily as he puts up with me and my zany ideas.

The fight for my FIL and the battle for me will only continue to get worse, but perhaps good thing will still emerge. This week was one small example: Hubby had his brother and sister here; together for the first time in almost 10 years.
