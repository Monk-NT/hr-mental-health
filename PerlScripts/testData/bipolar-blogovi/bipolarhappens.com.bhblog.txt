I have an interesting story to tell.  Here is a blog from a few months ago.  As you may know, my depression can get pretty darn severe- and I often think it will never end.   I then have a story at the end that is very hopeful.

Will This Depression Ever End and Can Anyone Help Me?

When I’m seriously depressed every single minute feels like I’m living in hell and I am just closer and closer to death.

 I sometimes get so depressed that I can’t move my head or have a conversation. I still make myself get out and do things. I cry and I feel I can’t go on, but I do. I feel better for having done something. Every minute when I’m well is filled with possibility because I can choose what to feel and what to do. People take this for granted. They take for granted that they can decide not to be mad about something or not to let others bother them.

 Bipolar disorder is not about fixing problems. I can fix my problems. I have a choice with that. The main problem I have is that I can’t always fix bipolar disorder. I can manage it, but I can’t fix something that is so broken. I feel this will last forever and that nothing will change for the future. I will be alone and old and have no purpose. What is the point of my life?

Here is what’s amazing. I find that I am getting better as I can now go through extremely stressful situations that would have led to months and months of depression – without actually getting depressed. This is a miracle. I call it mastering my bipolar disorder management. Or as my friend Elizabeth says, “Julie, you have become highly skilled in dealing with the mood swings. I still get sick a lot, but having a glimpse of how things can be keeps me going. My message to you and the message I tell myself even when I am super sick is keep going. There will be a time when things get better.

Are you kidding me? That can’t be how I’m seen because that is certainly NOT how I see myself. I see myself as someone who just has to get out of bed and hope the depression will not dog me all day! I see myself as someone who wants to be great, but often feels it will be impossible due to this illness. As you may know if you read my work- I’ve stopped feeling sorry for myself regarding bipolar disorder. It’s simply my life. All I can do is deal with it.  But it’s always there!

But Bad Ass! Really! On my Harley or something! Haha. It’s such a dual existence. I often go places and put my head in my journal and write my way though something stressful.   Others see that as intimidating! Hard to approach!  Oh, if people only knew. The only way I would use the above words is if I were manic- and then I would describe myself that way! haha. Mania knows no bounds.

Since my friends starting describing how the world sees me as compared to how I see myself, I am trying to blend the two.  So, if you see me somewhere alone and furiously writing in my journal, please come up and say hi!

I wonder what your friends would say if you asked them to describe how the world sees you? 

I just had lunch with my friend Gayathri. She is one of the most amazing people I know. She moved here from India in an arranged marriage over 20 years ago and just wrote her story in a new memoir.  She had a lot of depression and anxiety when she was growing up. She moved to America with her new husband and a lot of expectations.  Her descriptions of what it was like to go to a grocery store for the first time are amazing: “I never knew there were so many types of cereal!”

Gayathri and I became friend through NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) seven years ago. We have been friends ever since. Isn’t it great when you meet someone who understands what it’s like to have a mental illness? We have our own language. That is how I feel after I speak to a large crowd and I talk to people afterwards and I get to meet people like myself.

Gayathri was in the psychiatric ward two times after she had her first child. She writes about this in her book. The depression and anxiety simply became too much. I bet if you look at her  you would think- how could she possibly be depressed! Well, those of us who get depressed come in all shapes and sizes. There is no particular look.

I am thankful for Gayathri because she is there for me when I need her. Like today when it’s dark and rainy outside and I feel dark and rainy inside.  It’s so important to have friends who understand!
