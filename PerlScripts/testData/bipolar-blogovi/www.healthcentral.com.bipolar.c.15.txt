Several weeks ago, I bought a pasta-maker. It stayed in the box for nine or ten days. Then I got bold. I took it out of the box. Than I got really bold. I actually made some fresh noodles. In the days and weeks ahead, I worked at bringing up my noodle-meister skills to the level I have achieved with tacos and pizza. I am proud to say I will never again buy pasta out of the box (I lie, but I take it you get my drift).

 

Okay, this isn't exactly the same as suddenly deciding to take up humanitarian work full-time in a third-world country, but life is about the little things. The little things can make a huge impact on our well-being. We need novelty in our lives. Otherwise, we risk becoming "stuck," in a state of stultifying stasis that sets us up for depression and all manner of things going wrong.

 

Last night, I whipped up a batch of fresh noodles and served them up with butter-garlic-basil shrimp. How did that make me feel? Way better than popping something in the microwave and ruminating on all the things that are wrong in my life, thank you very much.
