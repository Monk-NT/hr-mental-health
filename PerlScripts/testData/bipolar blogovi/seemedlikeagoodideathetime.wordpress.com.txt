Ya know why I? fed up with it? It? certainly not because I don? have those. It? becauseÙI AM NOT THOSE! I? ME! I? me with some problems. But, I am more than just those problems. I? ME!

What is causing this rant? Just got off the phone with my sister-in-law, who is fresh out of the mental ward..AGAIN. She was rambling on and on about why she was admitted and then she saidÙ?hat are you? I? bipolar and have SAD (seasonal affective disorder)?

I answered, ?ell, I? ME. That? what I am?

She didn? get it. ?o,?she said, ?hat do the doctors tell you that you are??

I answered, ? don? really give a fuck what the doctors say that I am because I am NOT their diagnosis. I am ME and I happen to have BP, AADD, and a probably a little OCD. But, those are just labels. I am so much more than those damn labels.

I don? know about y?ll but I? sick and tired of hearing people who have not even been properly diagnosed  going around proudly announcing, ?? BIPOLAR? Not saying that some of them are not. Just sayin?that I think the psych doctors (and some lots of regular ol?MDs) are waaay to eager to attach a label to a patient, hand them some scripts for psych meds that will screw with their brains. All in about 15 minutes time. The ol?Treat ?m and Street ?m and get the next one in. Some do this out of total ignorance but there are many who do it out of greed.

They don? give a second thought to the long-term effects of many of the psych meds. No, at the end of the day, they climb into their cars and drive home to have a lovely dinner with the family. Meanwhile, many of their patients can? even drive a friggin?car because they are too screwed up from either the meds or the side effects. And, many don? have families anymore. And, many couldn? even sit upright in a chair to eat dinner even if they had a family.

SO JUST STOP! Don? ask me ?hat are you? I? METot a damn label. I don? play those games anymore.
