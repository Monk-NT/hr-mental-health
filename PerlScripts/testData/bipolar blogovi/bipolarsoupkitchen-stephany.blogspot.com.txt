
Various hospitalizations, and recovery in care facilities after being in psych wards other years, this year is what i couldn't believe until i sat back and thought about each year: first time my youngest will be home for Thanksgiving in 4 years. Other years i went to her. last year was particularly poignant because the long run of inpatient hospital ward doctor had stated his orders to give up on her and send her to the institution. from there, we battled and advocated and one year later she has appropriate care and is on the road to recovery--simple things such as shopping, counting money, playing basketball and walks--and the dog park. and outings to movies and the pumpkin patch. tomorrow she's in the house. the fridge is stocked with eggnog, and the dog is ready for play and dog park time!
