Oh but the church will be spared. He never quite explained what the signs of the second coming are. At least not in a specific way. Yeah I'm a little jaded in this regard; but he has said the same thing for three weeks now. I am Bible illiterate and so it is not my idea of a good time. He doesn't believe in global warming. He thinks environmentalists need to find a new line of work. He says that the earth will die and so why even try to protect it. Either your down with Jesus or your not right. Torture city.

I went shopping for a gift for my nighbor for the $5 gift exchange we are having. We drew names. I got him some toiletries that are travel size. I know that is kind of a lame gift; but what can you buy for five bucks these days. I bought a nice scarf and a pair of earrings and I can't decide which one to give a good friend that I will be seeing on Christmas. I might ask whether she wears small earrings or large ones.

So last week a neighbor who has become a good friend came by to say hi and I invited her to dinner. She was feeling really down. I love to cook for people because that makes them happy. I made italian breaded baked chicken, asparagus with garlic and rice. Then we had a little banana bread that I had made. We had such a warm time and I made both my roommate and my good friend happy. I was cheered up too.

I went to this store called Big Lots and bought a bunch of ridiculous stuff. I got some thick soft socks that are really supposed to be house socks; but I am wearing them with my shoes.

Last Thursday I met a friend at the dollar tree and we bought a few things for Christmas decorations. That was fun. I got a cd of music to relax to and glitter glue in red, green, and red. I was thinking of decorating some jars in that stuff and filling the jars with cookies or whatever. I have been doing a lot of shopping lately and will only have $200 until the 28th. Then I get paid again.

The other day I went to Pier One and got some delicous smelling incense. I bought two packs. Then I went to a drug store and got a beautiful hair clip with white and powder blue rinestones. I also went to a really great grocery store that is not in my neighborhood and got some healthy food. I also bought some dark chocolate covered espresso beans and some espresso coffee. Yum Yum!

I decided to go back to my therapist although I disagreed with her alliance with the staff at this independent living program about the methods used to do the recent urinanalysis. She gave me a reccomendation to try to hold off on meeting new men until after the holidays because I am too sensitive right now due to the holidays. And you know what that is an excellent idea.

Right now I am listening to a Christmas cd called World Christmas. It has typical Chirstmas carols in languages other than English or different styles than we are used to hearing. I am sitting with a sun lamp staring me in the face so that maybe I will get some more energy. I have been sleeping a good 11 hours a night. I wake up and it still takes me three big cups of espresso to come out of the medical induced coma. I hope that as I taper off of some of my Abilify that I won't appear to be in a stupor anymore.

On the way to church on yesterday the van stopped to pick a mother and her two chidren and I sat next to her daughter. The little girl was probably three or four and was cute as a button. She has down syndrome and isn't verbal yet. We were communicating though. She pointed to my wrap and I said yeah it is soft isn't it. She nodded. Then I lifted my scarf so she could feel it and she loved it and held it to her face to feel it. She looked like she wanted to sleep with it on her. I told her I liked her shoes and she wanted to look at mine. I held up my foot for her to see. Then when it was time for my client and I to get out I patted her shoulder and told her to have a good day. She waved goodbye to me. That really was a nice experience.

I kind of want to buy a new camera so that I can take a photo class; but the one I need is $400. See they reccomend a digital camera with single lense reflex. So when I get my renters rebate I will have $300. I got a Christmas bonus from work which was a $50 American Express gift certificate and a gift card to Albertson's grocery store as well as a gift card for Target. Wow I hadn't expected that! So anyhow if I only have to spend $50 of my own cash to get a nice camera I'd be thrilled. 


Yesterday I went to visit my friend Linda in L.A. and it took about 2 hours each way by bus. It was quite worth it as it was better than sitting home and dialing for apartments on craigslist. I begin to feel that that is a futile pastime because there is nothing affordable that is better that what I rent. But my point is that I had a great day. We went to Soup Plantation and her friend Susan joined us. We all will meet again with our friend Andy on the 6th of September at The Hamburger Hamlet in Hollywood. After that we will go to a movie. I think they want to see material girls; but they weren't sure. I am really picky about my movies and I pick peculiar ones; so I don't know if I will stay for the movie.

I am due to go to Sizzeler on Tuesday with the ups and downs club. My mom had asked me to go camping with her at the beginning of that week but I think I better stay here for now.

I decided to make the sizzeler restuarant my last meeting as the facilitator. I think that is better.

I am playing Evenescence on the cd player. I have different music for various moods.

I heard this radio program on KPFK earlier with an author talking about his book called Paranoia and Contentment. It sounds really good and can be bought on Amazon.com His name is John C. Hampsey. He explains that people who are paranoid are more creative. It also discusses the way people condemn those with delusions etc. and he references Joan of Arc and this Greek woman scientist who was later named Saint Catherine who was not actually christian but who was a paegen killed by the priests in 400 a.d. They didn't like her ideas. He thinks that people hate those who think outside of normal standards and these strange and creative people are actually the ones who push society along into newer and better things. He mentioned Virgina Wolff and Neitzche. I think I spelled the names wrong; but you get it. He said that Neitzche went into hysterics when he saw a horse being whipped on the street and he was forced to spend the rest of his life in a locked room. They said he was not a nazi type; but his sister was. I want this book.
