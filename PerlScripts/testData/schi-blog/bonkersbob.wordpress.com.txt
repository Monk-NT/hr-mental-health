I’ve been thinking recently about what my life was like before I decided to ‘get with the program’ and comply with treatment.

To an outside observer my life is much better than when I was non-complient, I’ve developed my portfolio of graphic design to a point where I stand a good chance of landing a job in a competitive industry and been able to function at a high level and cope very well with living on my own.

But part of me misses the thrill and inflated self esteem of when I’m losing touch with reality and I think I’m part of some cosmic battle and believe I’ve got miraculous powers, all of my most memorable experiences have been when I’ve been psychotic, both positive and negative.

Positive when I’ve experienced some incredible revelation and mystical insights, these positives were always followed by a much darker experience. The worst was when I was living with an amphetamine and heroin addict I met in hospital and having very paranoid and dark hallucinations.

I think I’ve come to the realisation that whilst being Jesus is exciting and a massive boost to the ol’ self esteem, it comes at a high price and I’m much better building on my normal low self esteem, then my mind won’t need to be Jesus to cope with life…

…the question is how do I do that?
