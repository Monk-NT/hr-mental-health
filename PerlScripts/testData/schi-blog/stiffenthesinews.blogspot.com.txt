
I've come to the point where 1) I've accepted suffering and 2) I'm willing to work harder for my health and sanity.

My path of discipline has been slowly progressing, and the more disciplined I am the more stable I am. This means I am willing to work harder at exercising 3-5 days a week instead of just whenever I feel like it, eating completely healthily, quit smoking, start projects I've been thinking about for awhile, stay focused on college courses, and controlling what I think about.

Now, controlling your thoughts is not about monitoring every thought that comes into your mind- you can't do that. But it is about immediately shifting your thoughts to something else when something comes up that bothers you or makes you sad, etc. I have been shifting thoughts slightly after a bad thought comes, but not immediately. Now I am ready to immediately do this. I have built up the strength.

I will be successful. Life isn't easy, but it's not impossible. It was only when I realized that I have to take a different path then others that I realized I would be successful. I was in denial about my illness and kept trying to do things the "right-normal" way. But I am completely satisfied now with my life's circumstances. I accept my illness, and I have come to the point where I don't just have faith that I will beat paranoid schizophrenia, I KNOW that I will. 

When you live every day like its your last day alive, you are more content. It also cools the flame of anger, and lightens the heart of depression. You give your love to the ones who are closest to you. You enjoy the small things. You live simply, and calmly. And you don't worry about the future. That is what my life is like. Although I'm dying wondering whether I was granted social security or not- because I'm excited about it- I'm not worried. I know if I don't get it this time around, then maybe next time.

As time passes on, I get better and better. I'm doing SO well these days. I am able to walk long distances without my headphones covering my ears. I am able to ride the bus also without headphones. Whenever I feel paranoid, I practice pranayama and clear my thoughts. It has taken a lot of mind training, and I am reaping the rewards.

I'm doing sort of well these days. My Psychiatrist increased my Haldol to 40mg a day, and so far so good.

I've realized that there is a reoccurring emptiness- an emotional void inside of me. I can't fill the void completely by my relationship with Matthew, by smoking, by curling up in bed and sleeping, by anything. The only thing that works to fill the void is by reading the Bible, and by praying to Jesus. 

The ironic thing about life is that everything is in motion. There is no real security. As time progresses we age, lose our health, and eventually die. We come into money, we lose money. We have every thing we need, and sometimes everything we want. But everything returns back to the earth, and energy converts us eventually into nothing. The only everlasting things are our souls, and God.

My ex-fiance dumped me because my parents didn't approve of him- and they refused to let me speak with him. I had to sneak around on the phone.

What's bothering me is that one night I dreamed I was riding on Pegasus while he flew over the sea. When I told Matthew of this dream he surprisedly remarked that awhile back he had dreamed about Poseidon. I think it means that we had a deep connection, and it grieves me that it's gone.

Usually when I have learned something that strengthens me, I write in this blog... But I want people to know that throughout the day I deal with weakness as well. I hallucinate, get a little paranoid/uncomfortable, I can't tolerate my thoughts, etc. This disease isn't easy to fight. If it were, then I wouldn't be sick.

I've finally made my decision on what degree I'm going to get: A BFA in Art (Drawing). My two passions in life are Art and Music. I want to spend the rest of my life with both.
