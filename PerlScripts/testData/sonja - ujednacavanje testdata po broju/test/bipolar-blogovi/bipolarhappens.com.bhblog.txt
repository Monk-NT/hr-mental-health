Ok. I don’t have a TV at home. I do play funny DVDs, especially when the depression is bad. If you have not seen Modern Family- you have not laughed!

Since I don’t have a TV at home, I go to my mom’s for our favorite shows and for my sports fix. And there is one thing I notice at this holiday time of the year.

If you don’t get a CAR or a DIAMOND of some sort for the holidays, you are missing out!

Yes, I am very careful around the holidays concerning my bipolar.  It’s the pressure. I can’t always have a fun time with my family on the holidays the way I would like.  Certain family members FIGHT.  (Certain family members have bipolar and depression!) And I can’t be around that for long. And this has affected me for many years. But I’ve learned to deal with it and things are much better.

Why am I telling you this? Because there is plenty of time for you to decide what YOU want this year.  This is whether you have the illness or care for someone who has the illness.

What do you want to feel?                                   Where do you want to  be?                Who do you want to be with?

If you have bipolar it is within your power. If you care about someone with the illness who is not getting help, or someone who often causes stress during the holidays. You have choices as well.

If you celebrated Thanksgiving here in the states. Was it fun? Good? Bad? Stressful? Awful? Wonderful?  The result of Thanksgiving can be your guideline.  I saw a dear friend of mine for Thanksgiving. Otherwise, I now know what I don’t want to do next year! 

It’s your choice.  Holidays can cause mania and depression and a lot of family tension!  I am going to be more jolly soon! I have a new car and a diamond!!!!!

It has taken years for me to make the holidays joyful. I work at it! I want the same for you. Julie

My mom and I are very close. I see her every day. She and my nephew are the reasons I live in Portland, Oregon.  This morning I called her from the place I watch football and asked her to bring me some cash as I forgot mine at home.  I told her the story of how I spent five dollars to help a guy with schizophrenia buy some food. He got a grapefruit, a lime, a small pear and some espresso bean chocolate. 

After I told her this, she said, “Are you manic Julie! You do this when you’re manic!” I said, “AM I MANIC!” and she said, “You always say you’re not manic when you’re manic.”  I got very upset. Not because of what she was saying. We use my Health Cards treatment plan together and she is always supposed to tell me when she thinks I’m manic. I got upset because I am very far from manic. For the past few days I’ve been profoundly depressed. I was up for a few days than a few of semi stability and then I felt the depression creeping in. So I did what I always do- I get out the ideas in Get it Done When You’re Depressed and I use them.  All day- every minute of the day. This means it’s hard for people to tell I’m depressed. I believe in acting as if I am well and getting on with my life.

My mom is my greatest support, but I simply can’t burden her with this illness all of the time. I keep a lot from her- because telling her that I’m depressed and worried and having trouble working is pointless- because I am in that mood off and on for a large portion of my days. I just work through it. I have other people to talk to. But overall, I believe that it’s up to me to use my management plan so that I can have normal relationships- and I have succeeded in this and it’s hard.

I said to my mom, “I know you are helping me and I know you see the signs of mania- but what you are actually seeing is my trying hard not to let the depression take over my day. I’m going to get out of this today and have a good day- so I am cheerful and active. That is how I get better. :

She said, “But you have to tell me when you’re sick- I want to know. How can I know how to help you if you don’t tell  me how depressed you are? ”

I said, “Because what helps me the most is going to your house and seeing the beautiful backyard and Cookie and hanging out. That is what helps me.”

So, dear readers. As you can see- this is hard on all sides. But I stick to my plan of always doing my best to manage this illness first and then asking for help when I need it. Otherwise, I would overwhelm too many people. It’s a balance. I think she understands.

Right now I am doing well. I am watching football and the weather is nice. I may even see my brother this afternoon. I believe I am the keeper of my wellness if that makes sense. My motto is treat bipolar first, and then I can go out into the world and get help when I need it! This is how I get so much done and have a life that is not always controlled by bipolar disorder. It is possible.
