I disagree, good idea, but incompetence is in all departments

Everyone has a boss. As a mental health advocate I have had to deal with far too many incompetent doctors and staff, nurses and other internal workers to understand that HR could have and would have, and in fact did not ever--do anything in regard to finding appropriate care or diagnosis for my daughter the last decade.

When finding myself with my daughter in precarious settings, such as the state institution as a result of bad doctors, choices to drug my daughter with forced injections by doctors, staff and nurses who look the other way, case workers who write charts wrong, cook the papers or remove them to their advantage when census is too high--discharge people to the streets or homeless shelters...I had no one to go to except one person to report it to: their boss.

They all have the same boss in this system, and everyone else's states do also:

THE GOVERNOR.

You do not stop in the HR department to hear their canned answers, and watch their dog and pony shows but for a few minutes, to understand one thing:

EVERYONE COVERS THEIR ASSES.

HR departments, all have people working to filter out the big mouths, the squeaky wheels, the mothers like me or the whistleblowers like Cheryl Eckard, so we don't reach the Executive level and bother them with the tit for tat fine print of the day to the big guy in the leather chair smoking a stogie with his feet up watching sports or reading the profit sheet. HR is supposed to prevent the needless trivial stories from coming to the Big Guy's desk. Who has time for that, when Big Bucks are to be earned? when internal documents are needing shredding? when internal documents and case studies are being called into court for testimony in off-label use cases?

Who wants to find out that a young 20something girl has gone missing a year ago, under the care of a facility ran by the state? who wants to be bothered with the long term injection given to her while in a 72 hr hold against her will, as a autistic person with no defense except free counsel who does not have any power to do a damn thing about it?

HR? hah! they tell the mother to go take a walk, let them take care of her child. HR covers plenty of asses, their own, theirs above them and who ultimately gets canned from HR in big cases are the people below them--such as case managers that are young, or newbies on the scene.

It's called COVER UP.

It's a nice thought, to think that the Big Execs or the Governor of a state are decent people who would never look the other way--but the fact IS that they depend on their lower level management crew far too much, listen to only what they tell them, and in fact they are served canned answers the same as inquirers.

THE EXECS AND THE GOVERNOR, as I use them in comparison here, as government IS a business, not a family friend

NEED to take responsibility for the actions of everyone they are above, which is everyone under them, including HR.

It is HR who receives my letters after being filtered down from the Governor's office to various appropriate levels and departments, and it is those people who then kiss my ass via letter to calm me down, and make false promises of future care--when in fact, it is what it is, canned BS in print.

NOT THIS TIME

My recent letter, which I have not discussed here regarding a massive state budget cut that encroached on my daughter's Constitutional rights, was received by the Governor as the others over the last 4+ years have, but this time, I received a bigger response. The topic is larger. It's not the workings of a manufacturing plant such as the one Cheryl Eckard blew the whistle on about GSK. Instead it's the internal system that governs and cares for all mental health patients and clients and Developmental Disability clients. It's the same system, the same umbrella agency runs it all: and there is one person who is ultimately every one's boss in the state agency:

THE GOVERNOR. THE TOP EXEC OF THE STATE IN CHARGE OF BUDGET.

Now, if I were to sue the state and ask for the Governor to serve prison time for all of the crimes against my daughter, such as the police handcuffing a mute and autistic person, or the forced injections, or the state ran care facility that refused to call the police when she was missing...all things have placed her in grave life danger, and all those people who made the decisions were told to do so by someone else above them--my answer is YES.

YES the Governor needs to be part of the catch all, not just the little case manager who took the fall for the director, who works under the Governor. The Governor, or the Execs in the 'Giles story all need to walk onto the property they govern, or monitor for their LARGE SALARIES and actually see what is happening INSIDE and at lower levels and STOP listening to HR that all is A-OK.

Then, the Exec and Gov can fire all who need it, and see and hear first hand accounts of the bad shit that has gone down in their respective business' and actually DO something before whistleblowers like Eckard or mothers like me expose them for what they are: overpaid, and ineffective corporate monkeys who think all is well at the end of the day because HR says so.

WRONG.

No one listened to Eckard's warnings and concerns so she had to go over their heads and she took them down, for the count. The company was fined $750 million dollars because HR and anyone else would not listen, including the Execs. Too bad when the Big Guys don't listen, the squeaky wheels prevail and get the truth out there. Maybe the threat of jail time at the Exec level will finally get them to stop "Business as usual" and actually DO something other than accepting the fines as that. Business as usual has met its match, eh?

Execs and Governors can be fired, sent to jail, fined or voted out

They both serve the public, and in this case Pharma Execs are being watch dogs for public health safety--same as I hold the Governor responsible and who watches over health care budgets.... and human beings.

Take the jobs seriously!


Various hospitalizations, and recovery in care facilities after being in psych wards other years, this year is what i couldn't believe until i sat back and thought about each year: first time my youngest will be home for Thanksgiving in 4 years. Other years i went to her. last year was particularly poignant because the long run of inpatient hospital ward doctor had stated his orders to give up on her and send her to the institution. from there, we battled and advocated and one year later she has appropriate care and is on the road to recovery--simple things such as shopping, counting money, playing basketball and walks--and the dog park. and outings to movies and the pumpkin patch. tomorrow she's in the house. the fridge is stocked with eggnog, and the dog is ready for play and dog park time!
