There's been a small wave of studies published in recent months concerning diet and depression. There was one asserting that the Mediterranean diet is protective against depression and another one asserting a link between processed food and depression. Now comes a new study in the American Journal of Psychiatry by Australian researchers asserting that processed foods--or what researchers deemed a "Western" diet--was linked with greater odds of depression (38 percent) and anxiety (9 percent) than was a "traditional" diet (odds ratio .78 and .81) or a "modern" diet (1.08 and .97 odds ratios).

The study looked at the dietary patterns of 1,046 women and, of them, 60 had dysthymia or major depression and 80 had anxiety disorders. So while the statistical power of this study may not be large, it certainly follows the pattern of other recent studies.

Late on Friday, the winter fundraiser met its goal of $4,000 raised. I'm humbled by the many contributions and appreciate everyone's support.

In other news, the first week of January is typically one of the slowest of the year as people get back to post-holiday reality, so posting will be rather light the first few days of the week (I'll have some new posts later this morning). I will be paying close attention to what's going on in Congress with the health care reform bills, but I don't expect things to heat up until next week.

Again, thanks to all of you who contributed and Happy New Year.


Another $45 from two people came in yesterday bringing the total raised to date to $3,815.26 from 87 people. Thanks to all of you who've contributed so far. There's still another $184.74 to go from 13 people to reach the overall goal of $4,000 from 100 people. Today is the last day of the fundraiser, so it'd be truly awesome if that goal were hit today.

There hasn't been a single quarterly fundraiser in the history of doing them on this site that has failed to meet goal. It'd be nice to keep that streak going.

Another $10 came in from one person yesterday and that brings the total for the fundraiser to date to $3,705.26 from 82 people. Thanks to all of you who've contributed so far. There's still another $294.74 to go from 18 people to reach the overall goal of $4,000 from 100 people and I would dearly love to hit that target by the close of Thursday, the last day of the year. But I'll leave that up to you all.

As I hinted yesterday, there's a major post up on the site today, revealing $1.25 billion in federal funds for depression centers (un-needed in my opinion) that suddenly wound up in amendments to the Senate health care reform bill on December 19, apparently to help snare the support of a single Democratic Senator. Amidst all the squawking in the mainstream media and in the lefty and conservative blogosphere over sweetheart deals for other Dem Senators, everyone missed what I've written about, even though the other giveaways pale in comparison on a dollar basis. I'll leave it to you to speculate as to why. But as I have mentioned before, this site does work that you won't find elsewhere in the media. And, in all modesty, I think it merits your support. Heck, it's a 2,000 word post. I won't even tell you what I used to get paid for such work back in the days before the Great Recession.

Thanks in advance for your support.

I hope you all are having a nice, peaceful holiday regardless of what you celebrate. My flight down from Seattle to Tucson yesterday was a complete pain in the butt--what has happened to air travel?--and I'd just like to say that US Airways stinks. But I'm enjoying the nice weather in Tucson--low 50s, sunny and two more hours of daylight a day than in Seattle this time of year. I need it.

I'll be back to regular posting on Monday.

Oh, yes, the Senate Dems passed their health care reform bill earlier today. I don't have much to say about it right now since the real action will come after the New Year when it has to be reconciled with the House version of the bill. That said, I'm sure you are all aware that the Senate bill is drawing heaps of criticism from both the political left and right. One writer at Firedoglake.com, about as lefty a joint as you'll find on the 'Net, described the whole business as "Obama's Health Care Cult of Personality" and offered a fairly decent critique of the bill. In less than one year, the President's most ardent supporters have turned into some of his biggest foes. Not sure if I saw that coming. I'm sure you can imagine what conservatives are saying about the bill.

Anyway, I hope the year winds down peacefully for you all.
