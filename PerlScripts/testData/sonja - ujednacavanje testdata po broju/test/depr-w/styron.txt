Anyone who is acquainted with some of the jagged contours of Jarrell's life--including his violent
fluctuations of mood, his fits of black despondency--and who, in addition, has acquired a basic
knowledge of the danger signals of depression, would seriously question the verdict of the coroner's
jury. But the stigma of self-inflicted death is for some people a hateful blot that demands erasure at all
costs. (More than two decades after his death, in the Summer 1986 issue of The American Scholar, a
one time student of Jarrell's, reviewing a collection of the poet's letters, made the
review less a literary or biographical appraisal than an occasion for continuing to try to exorcise the
vile phantom of suicide.)
Randall Jarrell almost certainly killed himself. He did so not because he was a coward, nor out of any
moral feebleness, but because he was afflicted with a depression that was so devastating that he could
no longer endure the pain of it.
This general unawareness of what depression is really like was apparent most recently in the matter of
Primo Levi, the remarkable Italian writer and survivor of Auschwitz who, at the age of sixty-seven,
hurled himself down a stairwell in Turin in 1987. Since my own involvement with the illness, I had
been more than ordinarily interested in Levi's death, and so, late in 1988, when I read an account in
The New York Times about a symposium on the writer and his work held at New York University, I
was fascinated but, finally, appalled. For, according to the article, many of the participants, worldly
writers and scholars, seemed mystified by Levi's suicide, mystified and disappointed.
It was as if this man whom they had all so greatly admired, and who had endured so much at the
hands of the Nazis--a man of exemplary resilience and courage--had by his suicide demonstrated a
frailty, a crumbling of character they were loath to accept. In the face of a terrible absolute--
selfdestruction--their reaction was helplessness and (the reader could not avoid it) a touch of shame.
My annoyance over all this was so intense that I was prompted to write a short piece for the op-ed
page of the Times. The argument I put forth was fairly straightforward:
the pain of severe depression is quite unimaginable to those who have not suffered it, and it kills in
many instances because its anguish can no longer be borne. The prevention of many suicides will
continue to be hindered until there is a general awareness of the nature of this pain. Through the
healing process of time--and through medical intervention or hospitalization in many cases--most
people survive depression, which may be its only blessing; but to the tragic legion who are compelled
to destroy themselves there should be no more reproof attached than to the victims of terminal cancer.
I had set down my thoughts in this Times piece rather hurriedly and spontaneously, but the response

was equally spontaneous--and enormous. It had taken, I speculated, no particular originality or
boldness on my part to speak out frankly about suicide and the impulse toward it, but I had
apparently underestimated
the number of people for whom the subject had been taboo, a matter of secrecy and shame. The
overwhelming reaction made me feel that inadvertently I had helped unlock a closet from which
many souls were eager to come out and proclaim that they, too, had experienced the feelings I had
described. It is the only time in my life I have felt it worthwhile to have invaded my own privacy, and
to make that privacy public. And I thought that, given such momentum, and with my experience in
Paris as a detailed example of what occurs during depression, it would be useful to try to chronicle
some of my own experiences with the illness and in the process perhaps establish a frame of reference
out of which one or more valuable conclusions might be drawn. Such conclusions, it has to be
emphasized, must still be based on the events that happened to one man. In setting these reflections
down I don't intend my ordeal to stand as a representation of what happens, or might happen, to
others. Depression is much too complex in its cause, its symptoms and its treatment for unqualified
conclusions to be drawn from the experience of a single individual. Although as an illness depression
manifests certain unvarying characteristics, it also allows for many idiosyncrasies; I've been amazed at
some of the freakish phenomena--not
reported by other patients--that it has wrought amid the twistings of my mind's labyrinth.
Depression afflicts millions directly, and millions more who are relatives or friends of victims. It has
been estimated that as many as one in ten Americans will suffer from the illness. As assertively
democratic as a Norman Rockwell poster, it strikes indiscriminately at all ages, races, creeds and
classes, though women are at considerably higher risk than men. The occupational list (dressmakers,
barge captains, sushi chefs, cabinet members) of its patients is too long and tedious to give here; it is
enough to say that very few people escape being a potential victim of the disease, at least in its milder
form. Despite depression's eclectic reach, it has been demonstrated with fair convincing ness that
artistic types (especially poets) are particularly vulnerable to the disorder--which, in its graver, clinical
manifestation takes upward of twenty percent of its victims by way of suicide. Just a few of these
fallen artists, all modern, make up a sad but scintillant roll call: Hart Crane, Vincent van Gogh,
Virginia Woolf, Arshile Gorky, Cesare Pavese, Remain Gary, Vachel Lindsay, Sylvia Plath, Henry de
Montherlant, Mark Rothko, John Berryman, Jack London, Ernest Hemingway, William Inge, Diane
Arbus, Tadeusz Borowski, Paul
Celan, Anne Sexton, Sergei Esenin, Vladimir Maya-kovsky--the list goes on. (The Russian poet Mayakovsky
was harshly critical of his great contemporary Esenin's suicide a few years before, which
should stand as a caveat for all who are judgmental about self destruction.) When one thinks of these
doomed and splendidly creative men and women, one is drawn to contemplate their childhoods,
where, to the best of anyone's knowledge, the seeds of the illness take strong root; could any of them
have had a hint, then, of the psyche's perish ability its exquisite fragility? And why were they
destroyed, while others--similarly stricken-struggled through?

when i was first aware that i had been laid low by the disease, I felt a need, among other things, to
register a strong protest against the word "depression."
Depression, most people know, used to be termed "melancholia," a word which appears in English
as early as the year 1303 and crops up more than once in Chaucer, who in his usage seemed to be
aware of its pathological nuances.
"Melancholia" would still appear to be a far more apt and evocative word for the blacker forms of the
disorder, but it was usurped by a noun with a bland tonality and lacking any magisterial presence,
used indifferently to describe an economic decline or a rut in the ground, a true wimp of a word for
such a major illness. It may be that the scientist generally held responsible for its currency in modern
times, a Johns Hopkins Medical School faculty member justly venerated--the Swiss-born psychiatrist
Adolf Meyer--had a tin ear for the finer rhythms of English and therefore was unaware of the semantic
damage he had inflicted by offering "depression" as a descriptive noun for such a dreadful and raging
disease. Nonetheless, for over seventy-five years the word has slithered innocuously through the
language like a slug, leaving little trace of its intrinsic malevolence and preventing, by its very
insipidity, a general awareness of the horrible intensity of the disease when out of control.
As one who has suffered from the malady in extremis yet returned to tell the tale, I would lobby for a
truly arresting designation.
"Brainstorm," for instance, has unfortunately been preempted to describe,
somewhat jocularly, intellectual inspiration. But something along these lines is needed. Told that
someone's mood disorder has evolved into a storm--a veritable howling tempest in the brain, which is
indeed what a clinical depression resembles like nothing else-even the uninformed layman might
display sympathy rather than the standard reaction that "depression" evokes, something akin to "So
what?" or "You'll pull out of it" or "We all have bad days." The phrase "nervous breakdown" seems to
be on its way out, certainly deservedly so, owing to its insinuation of a vague spinelessness, but we
still seem destined to be saddled with "depression" until a better, sturdier name is created.
The depression that engulfed me was not of the manic type--the one accompanied by euphoric highs--
which would have most probably presented itself earlier in my life. I was sixty when the illness struck
for the first time, in the "unipolar" form, which leads straight down. I shall never learn what "caused"
my depression, as no one will ever learn about their own. To be able to do so will likely forever prove
to be an impossibility, so complex are the intermingled factors of abnormal chemistry, behavior and
genetics.
