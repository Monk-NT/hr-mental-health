And then, six weeks later, I was out. The sun was too bright, noises were too loud, even getting on a bus was frightening. It was as if I was doing everything for the first time and I felt as vulnerable and as raw as a newborn.
But, amazingly I didn’t want to drink. The appalling compulsion
which used to sweep over me and frogmarch me into the off-license had gone. And there was something else—a tiny glimmer of pride (a first-time visitor in my life). I’d had enough of being other people
’s unpaid floor show.
I returned to London, where thanks to the extreme generosity of my boss and my colleagues, I still had a job. I also had my flat, and being able to slot back into those familiar things was a big help. All my energy was needed to get through a normal day. I was told in the treatment center that when I had bonded with alcohol in my teens, my emotional development had stopped. It meant that every time I had a disappointment or a row with someone, I didn’t live through it and mature from the experience; instead I sidestepped it, either by drinking immediately or reminding myself that I’d be able to drink at some later stage.
Now there was no escape, for the first time ever I was having to live life on life ’s terms. I went to twelve-step meetings, I ate a lot of chocolate, I disappeared into shopping and sleep and Jacqueline Su-sann novels, but I didn’t drink.
And I began writing again. I’d been terrified that I wouldn’t be able to write if I wasn’t drinking. (That whole tormented artist thing, I’d really liked that version of myself.) But no alcohol was required. (Someone at a meeting promised me it was perfectly possible
to still be a tormented artist without the drink.)
Full of positivity I decided I’d send my short stories off to a small Irish publisher, accompanied by a letter saying I’d started work on a novel. However, there was no novel—they took way too long to write, I’d decided. The instant gratification of short stories was far more me. But the publishers wrote back; they wanted to see my alleged novel.
I was mortified. In a blind panic, I started to write. I had no plot or character, all I had was the desire to avoid being caught out in a lie. In under a week, I managed four chapters, and still trying to catch my breath, posted them off. A couple of weeks later they replied—they were offering me a three-book deal.
Six months earlier I’d tried to kill myself; now I had a publishing
deal. How weird was that? For the first time ever I had to celebrate
without alcohol. (I bought a pair of shoes instead. Nearly as enjoyable.)
But fantasies of being able to waltz out of my day job and into a life of glamour were unfounded—my advance was an un-life-altering six hundred quid a book, so I fitted my writing around work, writing morning and evening.
In September 1995 my first novel (Watermelon) was published in Ireland and did very well. People talked about how funny it was. Even about sad things. In fact, especially about the sad things.
But I also got a couple of bad reviews, which totally knocked me off balance. I had no coping mechanisms for such public humiliation
and immediately—like every time I got upset—I was desperate
to drink. But I didn’t. Instead I went to bed with two slices of Marks & Spencer’s chocolate cheesecake and waited for the shame to pass. (A solution which works well to this day.)
In the meantime I’d started work on my second novel, a cheery little comedy about depression.
And I’d met a man. A very different kind of man from the ones I’d pursued while I was drinking. Even now I’m afraid to talk about how great he is in case I get nobbled by The Curse of the Smug Girl.
Then in September 1996, things moved up several gears. One afternoon I was at work, trying to balance the sales ledger, when a fax whined out of the machine beside me. It was for me, but it wasn’t a copy of an invoice or some other work thing; it was from my agent, saying that a big UK publishing house had just offered lots of money (ten times my annual salary, as it transpired) to publish me. I sat at my desk, my hands shaking, hitting the wrong buttons on my calculator—I still had to balance the sales ledger—wondering if it could be true.
It was and shortly afterwards foreign rights were sold to Germany,
Holland, Sweden and the U.S. Suddenly I could afford to give up my day job and—above and beyond my wildest dreams— become a full-time writer.
I’d been given a charmed life. But while the outside of my life had been transformed, it was taking a lot longer for my feelings to catch up with the facts. The insecurity and immaturity which had characterized my drinking were still alive and kicking and I felt confused
and unworthy.
Like every other time when I’d been knocked off balance, a drink seemed deliciously attractive, but I resisted. At some very deep level I understood that my sobriety was the foundation stone for every other part of my life and if I protected it by going to meetings
and sticking close to recovering alcoholics, I’d be okay.
Time passed and my third novel got published, then my fourth, all comedies about dark issues, and their reception humbled me deeply. Paradoxically, writing about feeling disconnected has connected
me: I got hundreds of letters, the gist of which was, “Your books describe exactly how I feel.” This, to the person who once felt she barely belonged to the human race.
Readers told me how well I’d captured their bleakest feelings—
and how I’d made them howl with laughter. And for the first time I saw that all those horrible years, mired in alcoholism, hadn’t been a complete waste.
And still I didn’t drink. I had thought that my sober life would be akin to crawling through a desert for the next forty years or however
long I lived, fixated on alcohol. I thought that I would devote every day to Not Drinking, that it would be a full-time job. But, oddly, it ’s not an issue. I’ve disassociated from it entirely—knowing that I can’t have any, not a single drop, makes it easier.
Mind you, it ’s very interesting being sober in a world sodden with alcohol. In my early days of recovery I went to the cinema a lot and for the first time noticed that nearly all the ads were for alcohol.
Not everyone understands why I don’t drink. After I stopped, I was visiting a friend who hadn’t seen me at my worst and she was baffled that I didn’t drink anymore. Carefully I explained that my body was so sensitized to alcohol that I couldn’t even take one mouthful without triggering a blazing desire, that it made me crazy and sick and that I was much better off without it. She listened,
nodding carefully, and when I finished she said, “Of course, of course. But you’ll have a glass of wine with dinner, won’t you?”
There are other people who don’t want to understand—people who probably suspect they might have a problem themselves; fighting
off their offers of drink is the hardest.
But in so many ways, life is normal. I had thought I wouldn’t be able to be around drinkers, that, green with envy, I’d be watching every mouthful of alcohol that they took and wondering how it was for them. But actually I enjoy it—at least, up until the point when people are telling me the same story for the third time or when they
have me hemmed into a corner, telling me glassily that I’m their best friend and that they love me.
Because alcohol was the center of my life for so long, I couldn’t imagine ever having such freedom.
It doesn’t mean that I don’t crave escape. There are times when I’m upset or angry or simply I’d like a night off from myself, and half a bottle of wine would unwind me nicely—and it’s simply not possible. I’m also sorry that there ’re all these newfangled drinks for sale now that I never got to try, like Bacardi Breezers. (I’m told they’re not so great, but nevertheless...)
And I seem to need more sleep than nonalcoholics. I think I must find full-on reality exhausting because at a certain point every evening I kind of hit a wall and think, “That ’s enough life for one day, now, thanks.”
But it ’s a small price to pay.
Over ten years later, I still haven’t had a drink.
It ’s been an incredible journey. More than ten million copies of my books have been sold worldwide, they’re published in thirty-two different languages, I’ve traveled the globe in the course of my work—but my sobriety is still the most important thing in my life. I know that if I drink again, I might never be able to stop. I got one chance and I treasure it. It ’s the greatest gift I’ve ever been given.
