All the boys his age had to
go. And Second Brother ran off to join the Communists two years after that. Big
Uncle's sons followed, then Big Uncle cursed that all three should never come back.
Mother didn't speak to him until the United Front was formed and Uncle apologized,
saying now it didn't matter which side they were on."
"And Mother, how's her health?"
"Remember how black her hair used to be? Now it's like an old man's beard, white
and wiry. She no longer dyes it."
"What? I thought it was naturally black from working with the ink."
"Don't be stupid. They all dyed their hair—Great-Granny, the aunts. But these days
Mother doesn't care what she looks like. She claims she hasn't slept in two years.
She's convinced the tenants are stealing from us at night and rearranging the
furniture. And she also believes Great-Granny's ghost has returned to the latrine.
She hasn't had a bowel movement bigger than a bean sprout in months. The shit's
hardened to mortar, she says, that's why she's distended like a summer gourd."
"This is terrible to hear." Though this was the same Mother who had kicked me out, I
took no pleasure in hearing about her difficulties. Perhaps a little bit of me still
thought of Mother and Father as my parents.
"What about Precious Auntie's ghost? Did she ever come back?"
"Not a wail or a whimper, which is strange, since that Catcher of Ghosts turned out to
be a fake, not a monk at all. He had a wife and three brats, one of whom was the
assistant. They were using the same vinegar jar to catch other ghosts, just opened
the lid, sealed it up, over and over. They caught a lot of foolish customers that way.
When Father heard this, he wanted to stuff the crook in the jar and plug it up with
pony dung. I said to him, 'If Precious Auntie's ghost never came back, what does it
matter?' But ever since, he's been muttering about the two ingots he lost, tallying
their worth, while according to him was enough to purchase the sky."
My mind was a sandstorm: If the monk was a fake, did that mean Precious Auntie
had escaped? Or was she never put in the jar? And then I had another thought.
"Maybe there never was a ghost because she never died," I said to GaoLing.
"Oh, she died for sure. I saw Old Cook throw her body in the End of the World."
"But perhaps she was not entirely dead and she climbed back up. Why else didn't I
find her? I searched for hours, from side to side and top to bottom."
GaoLing looked away. "What a terrible day that was for you. . . . You didn't find her,
but she was there. Old Cook felt sorry that Precious Auntie didn't get a proper burial.
He pitied her. When Mother wasn't looking, he went down there and piled rocks on
top of the body."
And now I pictured Precious Auntie struggling up the ravine, a rock rolling toward
her, striking her, then another and another, as she tumbled back down. "Why didn't
you tell me this sooner?"
"I didn't know until Old Cook died, two years after Precious Auntie. His wife told me.
She said he did good deeds that no one even knew about."
"I need to go back and find her bones. I want to bury them in a proper place."
"You'll never find them," GaoLing said. "The cliff broke off again last year during the
rainstorms, a ledge the length of five men. Collapsed all at once and buried
everything along that side of the ravine with rocks and dirt three stories deep. Our
house will be the next to go."
And I mourned uselessly: "If only you had come and told me sooner."
"What a pity, I know. I didn't think you'd still be here. If it weren't for Mr. Wei's gossipy
wife, I wouldn't have known you were a teacher here. She told me when I came
home for a visit during Spring Festival."
"Why didn't you come see me then?"
"You think my husband gives me permission to take a holiday when I want? I had to
wait for the way of heaven to throw me a chance. And then it came at the worst time.
Yesterday Fu Nan told me to go to Immortal Heart village to beg more money from
his father. I said to him, 'Didn't you hear? The Japanese are parading their army
along the railway.' Fff. He didn't care. His greed for opium is greater than any fear
that his wife could be run through with a bayonet."
"Still eating the opium?"
"That's his life. Without it, he's a rabid dog. So I went to Wanping, and sure enough,
the trains stopped and went no further. All the passengers got off and milled around
like sheep and ducks. We had soldiers poking us to keep moving. They herded us
into a field, and I was certain we were going to be executed. But then we heard paupau-
pau, more shooting, and the soldiers ran off and left us there. For a minute, we
were too afraid to move. The next I thought, Why should I wait for them to come
back and kill me? They can chase me. So I ran away. And soon everyone did,
scattering every which way. I must have walked for twelve hours."
GaoLing took off her shoes. The heels were broken, the sides were split, and her
soles had bleeding blisters. "My feet hurt so much I thought they would kill me with
the pain." She snorted. "Maybe I should let Fu Nan think I was killed. Yes, make him
feel he is to blame. Though probably he'd feel nothing. He'd just go back to his
cloudy dreams. Every day is the same to him, war or no war, wife or no wife." She
laughed, ready to cry. "So Big Sister, what do you say? Should I go back to him?"
What could I do except insist four times that she stay with me? And what could she
do except insist three times that she did not want to be a burden? Finally, I took her
to my room. She wiped her face and neck with a wet cloth, then lay on my cot with a
sigh, and fell asleep.
Sister Yu was the only one who objected to GaoLing's living with me at the school.
"We're not a refugee camp," she argued. "As it is, we have no cots to take any more
children."
"She can live in my room, stay in my bed."
"She is still a mouth to feed. And if we allow one exception, then others will want an
exception, too. In Teacher Wang's family alone, there are ten people. And what
about the former students and their families? Should we let them in as well?"
"But they're not asking to come here."
"What? Is moss growing on your brain? If we are at war, everyone will soon ask.
Think about this: Our school is run by the Americans. The Americans are neutral on
the Japanese. They are neutral on the Nationalists and the Communists. Here you
don't have to worry which side wins or loses from day to day. You can just watch.
That's what it means to be neutral."
For all these years, I had bitten back my tongue when Sister Yu was bossy. I had
shown her respect when I felt none. And even though I was now a teacher, I still did
not know how to argue with her. "You talk about kindness, you say we should have
pity"—and before I could tell her what I really thought of her, I said, "and now you
want to send my sister back to an opium addict?"
"My eldest sister also had to live with one," she replied. "When her lungs were
bleeding, her husband refused to buy any medicine. He bought opium for himself
instead. That's why she's dead—gone forever, the only person with deep feeling for
me." It was no use. Sister Yu had found yet another misery to compare as greater
than anyone else's. I watched her hobble out of the room.
When I found Kai Jing, we walked out the gate and around the back wall of the
orphanage to snuggle. And then I told him my complaints about Sister Yu.
"You may not think so, but she really does have a good heart," he said. "I've known
her since we were children together."
"Maybe you should marry her, then."
"I prefer a woman with ticks on her pretty bottom."
I slapped his hands away. "You mean to be loyal," he went on. "She means to be
practical. Don't fight differences of meaning. Find where you mean the same. Or
simply do nothing for now. Wait and see." I can honestly say I admired Kai Jing as
much as I loved him. He was kind and sensible. If he had a fault, it was his
foolishness in loving me. And as my head floated in the pleasure of this mystery and
his caresses, I forgot about big wars and small battles.
