Neither by will nor by choice had I became an abstainer;
the situation was puzzling to me, but it was also traumatic, and I date the onset of my depressive
mood from the beginning of this deprivation. Logically, one would be overjoyed that the body had so
summarily dismissed a substance that was undermining its health; it was as if my system had
generated a form of Antabuse, which should have allowed me to happily go my way, satisfied that a
trick of nature had
shut me off from a harmful dependence. But, instead, I began to experience a vaguely troubling
malaise, a sense of something having gone cockeyed in the domestic universe I'd dwelt in so long, so
comfortably.
While depression is by no means unknown when people stop drinking, it is usually on a scale that is
not menacing. But it should be kept in mind how idiosyncratic the faces of depression can be.
It was not really alarming at first, since the change was subtle, but I did notice that my surroundings
took on a different tone at certain times: the shadows of nightfall seemed more somber, my mornings
were less buoyant, walks in the woods became less zestful, and there was a moment during my
working hours in the late afternoon when a kind of panic and anxiety overtook me, just for a few
minutes, accompanied by a visceral queasiness--such a seizure was at least slightly alarming, after all.
As I set down these recollections, I realize that it should have been plain to me that I was already in
the grip of the beginning of a mood disorder, but I was ignorant of such a condition at that time.
When I reflected on this curious alteration of my consciousness --and I was baffled enough from time
to time to do so--I assumed that it all had to do somehow with my enforced withdrawal from alcohol.
And, of course,
to a certain extent this was true. But it is my conviction now that alcohol played a perverse trick on me
when we said farewell to each other; although, as everyone should know, it is a major depressant, it
had never truly depressed me during my drinking career, acting instead as a shield against anxiety.
Suddenly vanished, the great ally which for so long had kept my demons at bay was no longer there
to prevent those demons from beginning to swarm through the subconscious, and I was emotionally
naked, vulnerable as I had never been before.
Doubtless depression had hovered near me for years, waiting to swoop down. Now I was in the first
stage--premonitory, like a flicker of sheet lightning barely perceived--of depression's black tempest.
I was on Martha's Vineyard, where I've spent a good part of each year since the 1960s, during that
exceptionally beautiful summer. But I had begun to respond indifferently to the island's pleasures. I
felt a kind of numbness, an enervation, but more particularly an odd fragility--as if my body had
actually become frail, hypersensitive and somehow disjointed and clumsy, lacking normal
coordination. And soon I was in the throes of a pervasive hypochondria. Nothing felt quite right with
my corporeal self; there were twitches and pains, sometimes intermittent, often seemingly constant,
that seemed to presage all sorts of dire infirmities.
(Given these signs, one can understand how, as far back as the seventeenth century--in the notes of
contemporary physicians, and in the perceptions of John Dryden and others--a connection is made
between melancholia and hypochondria; the words are often interchangeable, and were so used until
the nineteenth century by writers as various as Sir Walter Scott and the Brontes, who also linked
melancholy to a preoccupation with bodily ills.) It is easy to see how this condition is part of the
psyche's apparatus of defense: unwilling to accept its own gathering deterioration, the mind
announces to its indwelling consciousness that it is the body with its perhaps correctable defects--not
the precious and irreplaceable mind--that is going haywire.
In my case, the overall effect was immensely disturbing, augmenting the anxiety that was by now
never quite absent from my waking hours and fueling still another strange behavior pattern--a fidgety
restlessness that kept me on the move, somewhat to the perplexity of my family and friends. Once, in
late summer, on an airplane trip to New York, I made the reckless mistake of downing a scotch and
soda--my first alcohol in months--which promptly sent me into a tailspin, causing me such a horrified
sense of disease
and interior doom that the very next day I rushed to a Manhattan internist, who inaugurated a long
series of tests. Normally I would have been satisfied, indeed elated, when, after three weeks of hightech
and extremely expensive evaluation, the doctor pronounced me totally fit; and I was happy, for a
day or two, until there once again began the rhythmic daily erosion of my mood--anxiety, agitation,
unfocused dread.
By now I had moved back to my house in Connecticut.
It was October, and one of the unforgettable features of this stage of my disorder was the way in
which my old farmhouse, my beloved home for thirty years, took on for me at that point when my
spirits regularly sank to their nadir an almost palpable quality of ominousness. The fading evening
light--akin to that famous "slant of light" of Emily Dickinson's, which spoke to her of death, of chill
extinction--had none of its familiar autumnal loveliness, but ensnared me in a suffocating gloom. I
wondered how this friendly place, teeming with such memories of (again in her words) "Lads and
Girls," of "laughter and ability and Sighing, And Frocks and Curls," could almost perceptibly seem so
hostile and forbidding.
Physically, I was not alone. As always Rose was present and listened with unflagging patience to my
complaints.
But I felt an immense and aching solitude. I could no longer concentrate during those afternoon hours,
which for years had been my working time, and the act of writing itself, becoming more and more
difficult and exhausting, stalled, then finally ceased.
There were also dreadful, pouncing seizures of anxiety.
One bright day on a walk through the woods with my dog I heard a flock of Canada geese honking
high above trees ablaze with foliage; ordinarily a sight and sound that would have exhilarated me, the
flight of birds caused me to stop, riveted with fear, and I stood stranded there, helpless, shivering,
aware for the first time that I had been stricken by no mere pangs of withdrawal but by a serious
illness whose name and actuality I was able finally to acknowledge. Going home, I couldn't rid my
mind of the line of Baudelaire's, dredged up from the distant past, that for several days had been
skittering around at the edge of my consciousness: "I have felt the wind of the wing of madness."
Our perhaps understandable modern need to dull the sawtooth edges of so many of the afflictions we
are heir to has led us to banish the harsh old-fashioned words; madhouse, asylum, insanity,
melancholia, lunatic, madness. But never let it be doubted that depression, in its extreme form, is
madness. The madness results from an aberrant biochemical process. It has been established with
reasonable certainty (after strong resistance from many psychiatrists, and not all that long ago) that
such madness is chemically induced amid the neurotransmitters of the brain, probably as the result of
systemic stress, which for unknown reasons causes a depletion of the chemicals norepinephrine and
serotonin, and the increase of a hormone, cortisol.
With all of this upheaval in the brain tissues, the alternate drenching and deprivation, it is no wonder
that the mind begins to feel aggrieved, stricken, and the muddied thought processes register the
distress of an organ in convulsion. Sometimes, though not very often, such a disturbed mind will turn
to violent thoughts regarding others. But with their minds turned agonizingly inward, people with
depression are usually dangerous only to themselves. The madness of depression is, generally
speaking, the antithesis of violence.
It is a storm indeed, but a storm of murk. Soon evident are the slowed-down responses, near paralysis,
psychic energy throttled back close to zero. Ultimately, the body is affected and feels sapped, drained.
That fall, as the disorder gradually took full possession of my system, I began to conceive that my
mind itself was like one of those outmoded small-town telephone exchanges, being gradually
inundated by floodwaters: one by one, the normal circuits began to drown, causing some of the
functions of the body and nearly all of those of instinct and intellect to slowly disconnect.
There is a well-known checklist of some of these functions and their failures. Mine conked out fairly
close to schedule, many of them following the pattern of depressive seizures. I particularly remember
the lamentable near disappearance of my voice. It underwent a strange transformation, becoming at
times quite faint, wheezy and spasmodic--a friend observed later that it was the voice of a ninety-yearold.
The libido also made an early exit, as it does in most major illnesses--it is the superfluous need of
a body in beleaguered emergency. Many people lose all appetite; mine was relatively normal, but I
found myself eating only for subsistence: food, like everything else within the scope of sensation, was
utterly without savor. Most distressing of all the instinctual disruptions was that of sleep, along with a
complete absence of dreams.
