The girls who had grown up in the orphanage since they were babies thought this
would be a lot of fun. But some of the students who had come later did not want to
deface the gods and tempt their wrath. They were so scared that when they were
dragged to the statues they screamed and foamed at the mouth, then fell to the
ground as if possessed. I was not afraid. I believed that if I was respectful to both the
Chinese gods and the Christian one, neither would harm me. I reasoned that
Chinese people were polite and also practical about life. The Chinese gods
understood that we were living in a Western household run by Americans. If the gods
could speak, they, too, would insist that the Christian deities have the better position.
Chinese people, unlike foreigners, did not try to push their ideas on others. Let the
foreigners follow their own ways, no matter how strange they were, that was their
thinking. As my brush ran over their gold-and-red faces, I said, "Pardon me, Jade
Ruler, forgive me, Chief of the Eight Immortals, I am only making a disguise for you,
in case the Communists or the Japanese come and recruit statues for a bonfire." I
was a good artist. With some of the gods, I glued on sheep's hair for beards, noodles
for long hair, feathers for wings. In this way, Buddha became fat Jesus, the Goddess
of Mercy was Mary of the Manger, the Three Pure Ones, boss gods of the Taoists,
turned into the Three Wise Men, and the Eighteen Lohan of Buddha were converted
to the Twelve Apostles with six sons. Any small figures in hell were promoted to
angels. The following year, Miss Grutoff decided we should also paint the little
Buddha carvings throughout the compound. There were hundreds of those.
The year after that, Miss Grutoff found the musty storeroom where I had gone to
reread Precious Auntie's pages. The statues there, Sister Yu said, were for a Taoist
diorama that showed what would happen if a person went to the underworld. There
were dozens of figures, very realistic and scary to see. One was a kneeling man with
horned animals feeding on his entrails. Three figures dangled from a pole like pigs
on a spit. Four people sat in a vat of boiling oil. And there were giant devils, redfaced
with pointed skulls, ordering the dead to go into battle. When we finished
painting those, we had a complete nativity scene, Baby Jesus, Mother Mary, Father
Joseph, everybody including Santa Claus. Even so, the mouths on the statues were
still wide open in screaming fright. No matter what Miss Grutoff said, most of the girls
did not think the nativity statues were singing "Joy to the World."
After we finished with those statues, there were no more idols to be changed to
angels. By then, I too had changed, from tutor to teacher, from lonely girl to one who
was in love with Teacher Pan's son.
The way we started was this.
Every year, during the small New Year, the students painted good-luck banners for
the temple fair in the Mouth of the Mountain. And so I was with Teacher Pan and our
students in the classroom one day, painting the long red strips, which covered the
desks and floors.
As usual, Kai Jing came by on his bicycle to take his father to his rooms. The ground
at Dragon Bone Hill was frozen hard, so most of Kai Jing's time was devoted to
drawing diagrams, writing reports, and making casts of different spots where bones
were found. On this particular day, Kai Jing came early, and Teacher Pan was not
ready to leave. So Kai Jing offered to help us paint banners. He stood next to me at
my table. I was glad for the extra hands.
But then I noticed what he was doing. Whatever character or figure I drew, he would
make the same. If I drew "fortune," he drew "fortune." If I wrote "abundance," he
wrote "abundance." If I painted "all that you wish," he painted the same, stroke by
stroke. He used almost the same rhythm, so that we were like two people performing
a dance. That was the beginning of our love, the same curve, the same dot, the
same lifting of the brush as our breath filled as one.
A few days later, the students and I took the banners to the fair. Kai Jing
accompanied me, walking alongside, talking quietly. He held a little book of brush
paintings done on mulberry paper. On the cover it said: The Four Manifestations of
Beauty. "Would you like to know what's inside?" he asked. I nodded. Anyone who
overheard us would have thought we were speaking of school lessons. But really, he
was speaking of love.
He turned the page. "With any form of beauty, there are four levels of ability. This is
true of painting, calligraphy, literature, music, dance. The first level is Competent."
We were looking at a page that showed two identical renderings of a bamboo grove,
a typical painting, well done, realistic, interesting in the detail of double lines,
conveying a sense of strength and longevity. "Competence," he went on, "is the
ability to draw the same thing over and over in the same strokes, with the same
force, the same rhythm, the same trueness. This kind of beauty, however, is
ordinary.
"The second level," Kai Jing continued, "is Magnificent." We looked together at
another painting, of several stalks of bamboo. "This one goes beyond skill," he said.
"Its beauty is unique. And yet it is simpler, with less emphasis on the stalk and more
on the leaves. It conveys both strength and solitude. The lesser painter would be
able to capture one quality but not the other."
He turned the page. This painting was of a single stalk of bamboo. "The third level is
Divine," he said. "The leaves now are shadows blown by an invisible wind, and the
stalk is there mostly by suggestion of what is missing. And yet the shadows are more
alive than the original leaves that obscured the light. A person seeing this would be
wordless to describe how this is done. Try as he might, the same painter could never
again capture the feeling of this painting, only a shadow of the shadow."
"How could beauty be more than divine?" I murmured, knowing I would soon learn
the answer.
"The fourth level," Kai Jing said, "is greater than this, and it is within each mortal's
nature to find it. We can sense it only if we do not try to sense it. It occurs without
motivation or desire or knowledge of what may result. It is pure. It is what innocent
children have. It is what old masters regain once they have lost their minds and
become children again."
He turned the page. On the next was an oval. "This painting is called Inside the
Middle of a Bamboo Stalk. The oval is what you see if you are inside looking up or
looking down. It is the simplicity of being within, no reason or explanation for being
there. It is the natural wonder that anything exists in relation to another, an inky oval
to a page of white paper, a person to a bamboo stalk, the viewer to the painting."
Kai Jing was quiet for a long time. "This fourth level is called Effortless," he said at
last. He put the booklet back in his jacket and looked at me thoughtfully. "Recently I
have felt this beauty of Effortlessness in all things," he said. "How about you?"
"It's the same for me," I said, and began to cry.
For we both knew we were speaking about the effortlessness with which one falls in
love without intending to, as if we were two stalks of bamboo bent toward each other
by the chance of the wind. And then we bent toward each other and kissed, lost in
the nowhere of being together.
