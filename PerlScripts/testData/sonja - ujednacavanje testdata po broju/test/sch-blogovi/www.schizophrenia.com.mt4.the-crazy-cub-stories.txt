I assume in the realm of mental illness that schizophrenic illness is the big bad motherfucker. Bipolar is like the nerdy kid envying the strong one from afar, not to say that it doesn't damage people's lives, but if you take severe schizophrenia and severe manic depression and compare, schizophrenia takes the cake.

The other part is that my treatment is forced on me, so I have no choice. If I could, I'd make a few changes. But that's all I'm going to say.


Why do I have paranoid schizophrenia? Why me? Do I have that much crummy luck? And why is my schedule decided by external forces? Fucking great right? Sure. The loser is the last one with the questions. The nerd is the crummy maggot. No point or purpose...

I probably have Paranoid Schizophrenia, but why is this what I have been subjected to? Medications, therapy, is there a point? So I have psychosis and when I do I can get violent. Luckily I'm always caught on time. Is that what I really want? Do I want to be ill to show off that I could beat it? Am I even really ill?

Anyhoo, school is turning out to be very demanding. No one is as much an idiot as they were before. Demanding work. Especially math. Kind of sad, because I used to be able to do math with a snap of my finger. Now? I need individual help.

I'm still expecting an e-mail from Pam Wagner, even though I'm probably waiting in vain.

Going to switch off the Geodon and try Invega. Yes, I responded negatively to Risperdal. So what? It seems better than fucking Seroquel or Zyprexa. Or maybe not.

Lot's of questions and no answers. Is this it? A whole load of answers better come fast. Maybe I should look around...


Now, I'm not a violent individual, but if I don't get my meds, my paranoia would get to the point to where I would hurt someone or potentially kill them with no remorse. Why though? Why does have to be me that is capable of such mayhem? Me, the nerdy guy at my school, the guy who has never been in a fight? It's all shit. And that fucking BBQ is one day away. I'll be back at school in no time whatsoever. But why do that? Why go to an idiot school where I don't learn anything. My meds make me incapable to learn anyway. What kind of life is this? This is not how people were meant to live. Yes, Christians will tell me that schizophrenia is my cross to bear and that I can get over it. I'm not so sure. I feel like crap and look like crap. What can prayer do for someone condemned like me? Condemned by this gloomy diagnosis from which there is no return. Could this be madness, this? It's like hell on Earth. I'm pretty fucked anyway. Not only am I going to hell, but I am also experiencing hell on Earth. What a lucky guy I am. Catch 22. Damned if I do, damned if I don't.

My friend doesn't get me at all. He's supposedly cured of ADHD, but he has no clue as to the suffering or pain that schizophrenic illness can bring. It's like dreaming whilst awake except there's only nightmares. Hellish voices, delusional ideas, and a lack of motivation for everything.

Well, whatever. That's life huh?

Everything that would be going wrong is. I have only one friend and a misunderstood illness that complicates every other part of my life. Now I have to go back to a school filled to the brim with moronic pubescent pond scum that can't find out the answer to the addition problem 2 + 2, and teachers who mean well but are misguided and let the morons do whatever they want. I've been at Pathfinder for two years and when I started going everything was fine. I was a little neurotic sure, but at least able to learn. Last year was a disaster. I was in and out of Children's hospital for what we called "Bipolar I Disorder with psychotic features" and I was open about my illness, which was a stupid thing to do, because when I did people were repulsed by me, like I was a freak. They never understood or cared. And the teachers of course, were concerned but hinted that I should quit psychotropic medications for good.

What will it be like to go back to that forsaken school, now that I have been gone for so long. What will they think? The kids won't be happy, I can tell that. They don't make fun of me to my face anymore but I'm sure that behind my back they are just ridiculing my every move and action. Sure the principal and teachers seem to care, but to an excessive degree. Like pampering me, as if they think I could blow up and kill someone on their watch. Just like the kids, they think I'm a freak. A schizophrenic mess who's liable to kill. If I don't get my meds, sure I'm liable to kill. But I have no choice but to take them because they are shoved down my throat.

Last year we started a 504 plan. It'll have to be revised. I'm no longer bipolar.

Anyway, that's all for now. Self pity, yeah, OK. Easy for some to say, they aren't me...

When my psychotic symptoms started and began to evolve, resulting in my first hospitalization of four in seven months, I was tried on a low dose of Risperdal, at personal request. The hallucinatory voices disappeared but my delusional thinking lingered. I hated the Risperdal and the idea of medications, so I started to have medication compliance issues...

When I didn't take the Risperdal, my voices came back and the delusions increased. My old doctor, Doctor David Hall, a somewhat famous doctor here in Seattle increased the Risperdal. Then I suggested we quit the Risperdal due to my having nightmares. The psychosis of course came back. So we increased the Risperdal, once again. But then the paranoia started, and everything lost it's happiness as I was increasingly losing my mind. We suggested switching to Abilify, which was a disaster. I didn't sleep, I had muscle stiffness, tremors and nausea at 5 mg. Unbelievable.

So we continued with the Risperdal going up to 4 mg. to no avail. At that point we considered Geodon, the drug I'm on now. We increased rather fast but it was working beautifully. Then the shit came down...

I was sleepy all day due to the Geodon, since we had to increase it up to 200 mg. which I'm told is a pretty fucking high dose. I still do have sleepiness but what's better? Homicidal/Suicidal psychosis or some sedation.

Geodon works for me now and perhaps will continue to work...


It's been seven months ever since I started hearing voices in my head, having delusions, and mood changes. It's been a long hard road with many diagnoses along the way. Bipolar, Schizophrenic, or Schizoaffective. Either one could be the culprit even though at this point it looks more schizophrenic/schizoaffective. Through all of it I've stomached my meds like a good boy and hoped for the best. It's amazing how I went from anxious and melancholic to psychotic and truly moody. This blog will hold my inner thoughts hopes and needs whilst reporting how my life is. For now, this is Phil, signing out. TTFN.
