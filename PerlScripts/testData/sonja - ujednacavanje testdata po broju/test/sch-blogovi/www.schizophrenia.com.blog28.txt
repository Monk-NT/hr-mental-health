I am chortling today. I don't know why except that I didn't go to the advisory board meeting today. What a relief! That is the stupid meeting I am supposed to attend monthly for my self-help group job. I flaked. Good for me. They treat us like we are retarded there.

Tomorrow I am going to visit Linda, a friend who lives in L.A. We are going to The Soup Plantation a restaurant that has a salad and soup bar. We will swim at her apartment. I haven't seen her since last October. She said she is not going to Big Bear Lake this year because they have been having a lot of fires. My self-help group takes a big trip there every September to stay at a campground in cabins. It is a lot of fun; but I don't think I will be able to go.

The pain was bad yesterday and I only went out to Walgreen's to buy some Naproxen. Later I felt all better and regretted wasting my day away.

I am re-reading a book I have had for years called Hot Chocolate for the Mystical Soul. It is so uplifting. Hearing spirituality told through personal modern experiences is better than reading the bible for me.

Wendy visited me on Thursday afternoon and we chatted for a while. She asked me to come swimming at her apartment this week sometime. I gave her the items I had purchased for one dollar apiece. She took most of them. She will pay me at the beginning of September when we get our Social Security.

I discovered these things called postys you can send online. You get to send a postcard with music and a poem. I got all into that last weekend.

Fardin and I still haven't eaten Indian food yet. He asked me to find a different restaurant because he passed by the one we were supposed to go to and it was empty and he figures maybe it is not that good. I found another one that is closer and where we can get 50% off with a coupon from the entertainment guide.

A group of people including family and friends is going to The Hollywood Bowl to see Willy Nelson next month on the 10th. I had really wanted to go the night they are having him with other people; but this should be fun.


Tuesday I went to OliveView hospital outpatient gynocology and had a tough day of it. But in the end after being treated in an undignified manner I left with prescriptions that appear to be just the ticket to recovery. I went to the pharm on Wednesday and they told me I'd exceeded my max on drugs for the month so they are writng treatment authorization requests. I was told by the pharm today (Thursday) that I must return to the hospital and get one drug there. That is a bother because the facility is in a mountainside and is difficult to access by public transit. Oh well, I am still happy they are assisting me.

Yesterday after going to the pharm I went to the funny farm. Or a local drop in center where I feel comfortable sometimes. I enjoyed myself immensely because everyone seemed very happy to see me and I felt like a queen. They were holding a chili cookoff and so we each sampled 5 types of chili. It was festive and crowded there.

I am still experiencing insomnia. But it is intermittant. On Tuesday night I fell asleep around 8pm and slept until 7a.m. That was so nice. But last night it was a wash since I couldn't sleep until 6:30 a.m. and I received a phone call and woke up at 9:30. I don't feel terrible; but I feel a bit dizzy. I hope this is not hypomania. I have been depressed lately which is due to life circumstances and the lack of Lexapro for 5 days. So today I decided to take all my drugs in the a.m. I cut the Lamictal in half so it is 50 mg now because I am worried that it is overstimulating me. I should phone the clinic today. I kind of wanted to sort it out myself. Sometimes life changes can screw up my mood or functioning. I don't want to be medicated out of feeling these experiences.

I am letting go of Will the great no show. I let go of two friends that were causing me grief due to what I classify as mysogyny. It is proactive to end so called friendships which ruin your self esteem. It was all about body image more specifically eating issues and weight issues. Some people including women don't value a woman unless she fits their definition of physical beauty. Of course Victor is gone and I have mixed up feelings about that. He may be in jail; I have no way of knowing anymore. So negative or not it is still a loss I am mourning. I don't know if I am burning my bridges or being healthy.

I have one friend that seems to be fading into the distance. I think this is her choice not mine. She doesn't identify with depression and I don't identify with psychosis and loss of sense of self. I also don't understand the occasional recreational drug use. Even a diet drug or a pain killer can be recreational when you have a chemical imbalance. This makes her high and a little psychotic.

I applied for federal student aid and received a speedy reply that I probably qualify to only have a $1,700 contribution to my education which means that I won't have to ask for much of a loan. That has made me pretty elated. Why didn't I do this sooner?!

I saw a request for submissions for a women's magazine on a blog on moodswing.org and I want to submit. I worry about my main peice of fiction being too graphic. I have only submitted it once. They are specifically seeking works of fiction and nonfiction etc from women who have mental illness.

They fixed my kitchen sink yesterday so I have tons of dishes to do. It is a positive though.


I got this comment on my blog a couple of days ago that pierced my soul. It said something like these poems suck and you should go commit suicide. What shit! I deleted it and fired off an angry e-mail to the monster that wrote it; but the letter came back mailer daemon. Maybe that is mispelled. But it was quite a relief that they did not receive it. Such bad karma. I was afraid I might get kicked off of here if I wrote that.

I am in again today. I am quite sad. Tori Amos is playing in the background. Will keeps writing and forgetting to make an effort to show up. I wrote him an angry e-mail yesterday and said that I felt that it is as if I am sending up smoke signals and beatiing a drum on a distant mountain. So I think instead of this continuous tease I am going to end it with him. His actions are telling. I feel like I am his prisoner and on occasion he remembers to slip me some food.

I heard a radio special yesterday about the life of Jimi Hendrix. It made me sad to hear how he od'd on sleeping pills. Was he manic and couldn't sleep or was he depressed and just done with it? I also remember when Kurt Cobain passed. I completely understood him wanting to check out.

I didn't get to go to the poetry meeting over the weekend. I couldn't sleep until 6:30 a.m. So I slept until 10:30 a.m. and felt pretty miserable. I haven't seen friends or family since last Tuesday and haven't been out much either. I have been maintaining contact by phone though.

I don't know if I explained that I fired my case manager/therapist. I did it because she disrespected me when she did not return my call about Victor. She called the day of my appointment when I didn't show up and yelled that we had an app. and that she was planning on discussing the issue during our session. She had told me to call her between sessions if I ever needed support. So I lost trust in her. I guess she taught me how to set up boundaries. She reccomended that I break off friendship with three individuals I knew because of their dysfunctional behaviors and was hinting that Will was not really all he presented himself to be. I am glad that she clued me in to people's b.s. and that I deserve better. But now what? I am growing stronger in ways and feel weaker in ways too.

Today I am waiting for the plumber to show up and repair my kitchen sink. I haven't been able to use it for about 5 days. They don't have emergency maintenance here so it was postponed for a while. This feels kind of slummy.

I feel hungry and cold because of hypoglycemia; but I am tired of having to eat every two hours. It gets old.

My meds are screwy right now because I have missed a few doses of Lexapro. I ran out and will get more tomorrow. I haven't felt well enough to go get it.

I spent a long time last night writing an essay for my application to Antioch University in Culver City,California. I still haven't submitted the online application yet because I must wait to get the $60 app. fee. That is finally a move in a positive direction. I thought maybe I could tie in creative writing with psychology to form a degree that would enable me to work with special populations like abused people or people with mental illnesses.

Today is Friday and I had plans today that I don't know if I will be able to carry out because of the pain. My sister told my mom that she just started taking Sarafem for Prementstrual Disorder (it is actually called PMDD but I forget what the letters mean). That drug is actually Prozac. So I am going to try to get Prozac. I think that a Gynocologist might be hesitant to give me that because I am taking other antidepressants and they are not specialists in how to titrate these drugs. But I will try to get it anyhow on Tuesday when I go to Olive View Gynocology. Perhaps I won't need a surgery after all. Today it is hard to go up and down the stairs in my apartment because of the pain.

I actually stayed up all night last night. I was up till 4:30 a.m. That reeked! I made the mistake of taking Lexapro at night and I think that caused it. Before the Abilify was strong enough to make me sedated at night despite the Lexapro; but now with less Abilify I must begin taking the Lexapro in the morning.

I need to get to the pharmacy today. I could have them deliver possibly. I am going to call and ask for in-home supportive services which is a needs based program where they have a caregiver come and do chores for you if you are disabled. Somedays I can't do chores or run errands. I could use a ride to the dollar store sometimes or to a healthy/gourmet store that I can't get to by bus. It is a program offered by county social services.

I did not go out with the man from the meeting who asked me out eventhough he said it would be platonic. He is 50 and I am just not interested in him. I could go out with him just for fun; but I can't decide. I am not seeing Fardin today because he had something he had to do today. That seems to be how it is going for me lately. It actually worked out fine that way because I am sick. 

I was supposed to go on an interview today with a company that hires teacher's assistants to go into homes and work with autistic children; but I decided I am not up to it. It pays $12 and up and is part time. I wasn't sure if they were going to demand that you have a car or not.

I want to talk to my supervisor about starting a club which is purely for fun. I used to run a club like that in the 90's and I enjoyed it. We would go bowling, to movies, play board games,etc. We could just meet at a restaurant and then go places together.

My mom just called and she just purchased a timeshare to a series of campgrounds and vacation rentals in the U.S. and Europe. She gets 10 free days and then she pays $49 per night after that. She wants me to invite friends to go on vacations with us. That sounds really neat. I can't wait!

I signed up on Yahoo personals. I have three responses so far. I am having fun with that. One guy asked me out for coffee at Starbuck's and I wrote him back to say that Sunday would work for me.

I am going to the poetry meetup at a local cafe tomorrow at 3:00. They e-mailed me and said that six other people are going. I must get 10 copies of each poem I want to share. This should be interesting. I will try to pick poems that are not that morose. I really hope that tomorrow is a healthier day for me.
