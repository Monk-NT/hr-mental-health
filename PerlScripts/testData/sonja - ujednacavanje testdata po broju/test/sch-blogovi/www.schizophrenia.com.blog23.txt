Bad crazies last night. I had an argument with my boyfriend about him saying that he doesn't like me. But we stopped arguing and soon he was snoring. Then, the voices that I always have started getting louder and louder. They screamed as a monster loomed out of the darkness. I stole out of bed without waking my boyfriend and stepped into the cool night air outdoors.

Now what was it my therapist had said? Practice paying attention to reality. I needed to give myself a distracting task. So I went to the gas station in my pajamas at 3am to buy bubble gum. Strange men followed me, and I watched the liquid movements of dog-like monsters as they stalked me. The voices said that a spy was eyeing me. I combed my hair nervously with my fingers until it was frizzy. At the gas station, I purchased Bazooka Joe gum. But, once I left the station, the monsters weren't going to let me go home unless I did a good deed, because they said I never did anything right. They said that, if I tried to go home before doing good, they would tear off my skin to show my boyfriend how black I was inside. Then he would never like me.

At that time, I found a Fred Meyer shopping cart, so I decided that I would return it as my good deed. At 4:10am, the city of Bellevue turned its sprinklers on and I was drenched. I walked 2 miles with a shopping cart in the night, discheveled and in wet pajamas, all the while glancing over my shoulder and mumbling to myself while blowing big pink bubbles with my gum.

With my task completed, I pondered whether I should take a different way back, so the monsters wouldn't find me. I opted to take the same way back. I had tried my best, and now it was time to face my fears. On my return, the monsters crossed and re-crossed their paths in front of me. Eyes pressed in all around me. The voices taunted and growled as my thoughts clustered in a corner of my mind like scared mice. I broke into a run. A lady in a black and red dress was in front of our house and she reached out to warn me, but I passed on by.

When I returned home, my boyfriend was awake and angry. He said that I lied to him about leaving the house, because I had tried to make a deal with him earlier to that effect that I didn't think he agreed to. He said he couldn't take this anymore. He yelled at me, shrank away from my touch, ignored my pleadings and refused to be in the same room as me. I didn't sleep last night. So, in the end, my good deed didn't work and my monsters were right. Bad crazies last night.


Just how long am I supposed to be living like this anyway? With my craziness popping up at odd times. I know that depression counsellors get taught to tell us that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. That part of depression is thinking that it's going to last forever. Well, I thought there was a light. I've suffered for months thinking there was a light. And you know, I don't want to suffer even one month more.

Tonight I freaked out for no reason even though I'm on the pills. Am I faking all of this just so that I can get concern from people? Because my boyfriend was mad at an unrelated matter at the time, maybe I just subconsiously fake it so I'll get more attention or something. At any rate, I called my therapist so maybe he can do some of that therapy he's supposed to be doing.


Like it has been doing almost every night.

I called one of those Crisis Hotlines after I went on a walk. They gave me numbers of counselors that work on a sliding scale. Because, I'll be frank with everybody now... It's late and I care not. I've been a psycho bitch. I've been hallucinating from lack of sleep and trying to act normal but now it's just fucking everything up. I miss the way I used to be. I'm sure I'll feel just hunky dory tomorrow and forget all about calling the counselors though. I just want to move far far away.


Me so tired, but my boss brought doughnuts to work today. I had the worst night's sleep last night. My brain was playing tricks on me so bad. It hasn't been that bad since I was a little kid and would hallucinated monsters in tree branches outside my window. I don't know what the hell was up with it. The fan was making annoying noises and sounding like it was talking at me, and then I kept on seeing these freaky images that wouldn't let me breathe and sleep properly. Rarr. Go away sleep demons! Heh, as if a scary movie will help things, I'm going to go see "Red Dragon" tonight!

I had a bad night last night. I would complain more, but I'm off to Portland Oregon. To see a reptile show and wish my boyfriend's mom a happy birthday.

Well, I can be pretty sure that I wasn't given the placebo. Yesterday morning I felt a little dizzy and had a head-ache. But today, it had escalated to not being able to stand. I was continuously falling into things and loosing consiousness. After crashing around the bathroom for a time, unsuccessfully attempting to get dressed, I called the research people. Then, I discovered how disorganized my thoughts were. I couldn't speak correctly! I tried to tell her I was having "side effects" but it came out "heart attacks" repeatedly! I get to stop the drug, and then they'll talk with me about it on my Wednesday appointment. They want to try tapering me on it slower. Fuck that! Up until the last month, I hadn't taken ANY anti-psychotics for over a year. Then, I got it in my head that maybe I should experiment with them again... That maybe I didn't give them a chance. Rediculous! Now I'm getting a well-needed wake-up call, reminding me of why I was doing so well without the drugs in the first place!

I'm feeling much better now, thanks to an extremely short half-life of the drug. I'm glad I don't have to take it today or tomorrow, or the next morning. I really want that $200 for the study, though. I'll have to listen to what suggestions they have. I managed to go to work today, after pacing around and drinking lots of water to get some of the drug out of my system. I was doing just peachy with my old, stable self before. Chemical lobotomies are bad M'kay?
