I've been feeling really good. Weekends are usually the hardest for me because I feel like there is no structure. I made it through ok. I even had my husband cut my hair. I felt I needed a change. I haven't had my hair cut in over 10 years. It was really long and now it is up to my shoulders. It's a weird feeling with it gone, but I like it.


I feel good today. I went to the grocery store and I am making cookies for my daughters 4-H bake sale tomorrow. I watched some TV and played a video game for awhile. I don't have to see my Psychologist for another month.

Christmas and New Years went by without any problems. I'm still doing well and I feel good. I also feel lucky because I know there are other people with the same illness that has a more severe case than I do. I like to think that I will myself to get better and I am in control. The fact is if I would have waited any longer to seek treatment I would probly be as incoherent as some cases are.

I've seen both my doctors in the past week and they both say that I am looking good. None of my medications had to be switched and I don't have to go back to my Psychiatrist for 6 months! (Unless I need him)
I was so happy to hear him say that.

My husband and I got the stove taken apart the other day and put back together and cleaned. Now I am not afraid to cook. I celebrated by making French fries and chicken nuggets.

I am so happy that my medications are working. I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of back and forth. There are only a few things I notice but aren't that bothersome. Like, sometimes if my husband touches me I have an urge to hit his hand away. I just don't like to be touched sometimes and I don't know why. Sometimes I find myself in a stare and in my own thoughts, but I usually snap out of it. None of it is worrisome to me, I'm just glad I feel better.



Now that I have been on my meds for awhile I can look back and see how my behaviors in a lot of situations should have been a warning sign.

I would constantly make my husband uncomfortable in public, especially in grocery stores. I would confront everyone that made me mad. Wheather they were in my way or if I thought they looked at me wrong or if I thought they were too close to me. I would say things like "Do you have a problem?" or "Excuse Me!" Sometimes I would just move fastly with my grocery cart and if they didn't move they would get hit.

One time I had bought sausage. My daughter loves sausage sandwhiches so I would fix her one before school every morning. That week she had gotten sick everyday. I fianlly figured out and checked the date on the sausage and it was expired by over a month! I told my husband to take me to the store. He let me go in by myself. I went to the meat dept. and checked the dates on the sausage and sure enough they were expired. I continued to pull 30 ponds of sausage off the shelf and put it in my cart. I had no idea what I was going to do with it, but I was so mad. The employees started to move toward me and I remember feeling threatened. I was yelling and telling them about the sausage and then one of the young men that worked there said "It's your responsibility to check the dates." At that moment I had such an anger inside me that I raised my hands and hit him at leat three times in the face. After I did that I just knew I was in big trouble. I fled the store as fast as I could and yelled for my husband to start the car. We did get away.


I was off my meds for 4 days and on the 4th day my symptoms started coming back. It started with starring out locked in my thoughts and then the voices and paranoia came back. I knew I had to do something that I couldn't go on like that. I called my doctor and had him split up my meds dosage so I could better tolerate it. Thank goodness he agreed. A lot of Psychiatrists wont listen and think they know it all, so to speak. I am lucky to have one that will. I am also lucky in a way that I can sense my illness and know when something isn't right. I never used to be that way. I can remember when I always thought I was right and everyone around me was just out to get me or do me wrong on purpose.

Even on my meds though I still don't like going places or being around people. I instantly get anxious if something is out of place. My kids have a schedule and they think it is to teach them responsibility and time effeciancy, when actually it is to keep me straight so I know what is going to happen when. I guess it does teach them good things, but I feel guilty. They have their chore times and tv times and even homework times. They arn't allowed in the kitchen while I am cooking. They think it is because I'm afraid they will get burnt, but it is so I can keep my head on straight and not burn the house down.

I have read a lot of articles that say I am supposed to get plenty of rest and low stress and take it easy. I can't let myself fall into the victim role. I have a husband and kids that need me and they need me to be responsible. It wouldn't do my family any good to fall apart. My husband and I do have a cue if I feel I am going to get out of hand though. I walk away and go into my computer room and shut and lock the door. That tells him I am not okay and I do need to be alone until I can control myself. I decide when I can come out and he doesn't bother me and doesn't let the kids bother me. That seems to work well and the kids don't know anything is wrong. They just think I'm on the computer.

I stopped taking my Geodon a couple days ago. I am on 60 mg once a day and it is too much all at once. Makes me really tired and nervous and fidgity. I noticed today I felt better off of it. I don't know what my doctor will say, but my guess is something to the effect of "Are you crazy?" Pun well intended.


Imagine waking up and having coffee. Then you walk through your house because you sense that someone is there. You don't find anyone, but the feeling is still frightning. If they arn't inside then they must be outside. So then you proceed to take your mini telescope to look out the window into your woods, because they must be out there. You still don't see anyone. So then you figure out it is cameras hidden up in the trees looking through all your windows and someone or some people for some reason are watching you. You begin to be very nervous. You try not to think about it. Then you proceed to go to the bathroom to brush your teeth, but you can't look in the mirror because last time you did that your face changed into someone elses. So you keep your head down and hurry as fast as you can to get done. Then your phone rings. You hate phones. You pick it up to answer and it is your husband. You hear a clicking noise so that means someone has tapped the phone and is listening to everything you say. You try to ignore it. After your call you go to your computer to check your email. The lady in the advertisement on your page wont stop looking at you. She wants you to talk to her. You ignore her the best you can. After you get done on your computer you have to go out to the grocery store. When you get there someone wont stop following you. Everytime you turn around someone is there watching everything you do. You get scared. Your skin starts to feel hot and sweaty. You are panicing. You have to flee the store to get away from whoever it was that was wanting you. You go home and shut yourself in a room after taking your xanax praying that you will feel better soon. You turn your radio on and scream and cry and wish it would all go away. You lay on your bed for 2 hours sobbing and singing with the music. You look at the clock and it is almost time for your kids to get home from school. So you have to pull yourself together for their sake because they don't know mommy is sick. You worry you will say or do something in front of them, but all you can do is pray they are not effected by the monster that lives insde you.

I started seeing a psychologist who told me I had Paranoid Schizophrenia and that he was going to help me. I have been back and forth on differents medications since September 2007. I have had plenty of ups and downs and was hospitalized one time overnight. I hated the hospital and no matter how bad I feel I wont go back.

I am currently on Geodon, Xanax, sleeping pills and an anti depressant. I'm not sure how it is working. I seem to always be real fidgity and nervous. Like my insides want to jump out of my body. I no longer hear voices or have hallucinations and my delusions have also subsided. I still am feeling a little paranoid at times though. I still feel really down. I don't think this new medicines have taken effect yet.

woke up feeling pretty tired this morning. I think I need to switch the time I take my meds. I also have been feeling really jittery like I don't know what I am supposed to do.

I'm feeling really anxious about having to make a big dinner today. I hope I can do it. The upside to today is I got up and got dressed and also did my hair and even vacuumed some. That may not be a big deal to most people but for me it is.I only got dressed one time this week.

My husband is being very supportive of my needs and always asks me if I am ok. I just wish he didn't have to have that burden. Always worrying about me.
