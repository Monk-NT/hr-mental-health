Our fam­ily has been through some major tran­si­tions over the course of the past year, and the evening of June 3, 2010, not only felt like the cul­mi­na­tion of all the changes we have expe­ri­enced recently, it also marked the end of one long chap­ter of my life. It was excit­ing, ful­fill­ing, sat­is­fy­ing … and both men­tally and phys­i­cally exhausting.

We don’t always know, at a pre­cise moment in time, that we are expe­ri­enc­ing the end of an era, a jour­ney, an ongo­ing event, a rela­tion­ship. Some­times we don’t under­stand until later that a finite point in time was indeed that moment of final­ity. In other cases, the full weight of reach­ing the end of some­thing bears down on us as the moment approaches and for a period of time after­ward. In those cir­cum­stances, we have the oppor­tu­nity to antic­i­pate and pre­pare for that life-altering moment, but we can’t always pre­dict how we will feel once it arrives.

So it was with my youngest son’s recent grad­u­a­tion from high school.


My boys at Christ­mas­time, 1991. Robert was 4 1/2 years; Matthew was just one month old.
Obvi­ously, like any proud par­ent, I looked for­ward to the evening when I would watch him march in with his class to the strains of “Pomp and Cir­cum­stance” wear­ing his silly-looking mor­tar­board and robe, and col­lect his hard-earned diploma. That small piece of paper sym­bol­izes the cul­mi­na­tion of twelve years (not count­ing preschool and kinder­garten) of drag­ging his sleepy butt out of bed, get­ting him dressed, mak­ing sure his back­pack held every­thing he needed for the day, and dri­ving him to school on time (hope­fully) before head­ing off to work. Along the way, there were also many days when I had to arrange for some­one else to per­form those parental respon­si­bil­i­ties for me while I was out of town on busi­ness trips. When he was in ele­men­tary school, my mother was still alive and able to drive to his school. There were days when his father worked over­time, so he was excited about rid­ing in Nana’s car to her house. Later, when she could no longer drive, he became well-known to the local dis­patcher who took my calls for appoint­ments with our local Dial-A-Ride ser­vice. She would say, “Oh, Matthew’s going to Grandma’s today!” with­out ask­ing for the address. After my mother began resid­ing in an assisted liv­ing facil­ity and we moved into the house my par­ents built in 1959, that dis­patcher con­grat­u­lated and com­mended us for keep­ing the home in the fam­ily — and assured me that Matthew would be picked up and deliv­ered to our new home safely.


Of course, along the way, there were count­less hours of home­work, includ­ing all those spe­cial projects that sent me scur­ry­ing for clothes­pins, yarn, Sharpie pens, glue, uncooked pasta, bub­ble wrap, bits of cloth or felt, shoe or cereal boxes, bub­ble wrap … even eggs for the annual eggstrav­a­ganza I dreaded most of all, the egg drop! Yes, both of my boys had to endeavor to clev­erly con­ceal a raw egg in some sort of pack­ag­ing that would cush­ion it against being dropped from the roof of the school­house! Nei­ther of them ever won that con­test. And in Matthew’s case, I do mean scurry because for twelve years, he was the kid who never brought home the weekly newslet­ter or the daily bul­letin. I wish I could count the num­ber of times he announced, just as I was com­ing through the door after a long, stress­ful day at work, “Mom, my ________ is due tomor­row! Do we have any ______?” Since he usu­ally needed some­thing we did not have stocked at home, his father was dis­patched on emer­gency trips to the store, while I stayed behind to brain­storm with Matthew about the assign­ment. Plenty of times I enlisted the assis­tance of his older brother who, for­tu­nately, had com­pleted the same assign­ment a few years ear­lier and could pro­vide valu­able advice.

I remem­bered and, for the most part, laughed about those times in the weeks and days lead­ing up to Matthew’s big night. Of course, there were also a few lumps in my throat as I recalled some of the more trau­matic and poignant times. In par­tic­u­lar, I thought about how upset my mother was when she arrived at his school to attend his kinder­garten grad­u­a­tion cer­e­mony. Still en route, I answered my cell phone and heard, “Mat­tieBoo is so upset. Are you on your way?” He was sit­ting qui­etly off to the side, away from the other chil­dren, cry­ing. After some prob­ing by Nana, he finally told her that he wished he were dead! By the time I arrived, my mother, being the expert mater­nal detec­tive that she was, had dis­cerned that poor lit­tle Mat­tieBoo did not know he would see his kinder­garten teacher after that day. He thought grad­u­a­tion meant that he would be for­ever sep­a­rated from her! I knew that he loved Sue Hum­mel — as did most every child who was ever lucky enough to be her stu­dent — but the level of attach­ment he had formed to her and its impact on him was a com­plete shock. How could I have guessed that he did not know his first grade class­room was right around the cor­ner from Mrs. Hummel’s room and, as a first grader, he would be able to visit as often as he wanted? After Nana and Mrs. Hum­mel assured him that she would see him every day next year on the play­ground, he calmed down and hap­pily accepted his kinder­garten diploma as my mother and I, both cry­ing from a mix­ture of relief and pride, looked on.


My boys on June 3, 2010, the evening Matthew grad­u­ated from high school. He is 18, and Robert is now 23.
It was a sim­i­lar mix­ture of relief and pride that washed over me the evening of June 3, as that lit­tle boy — now 6' 3” tall with a very deep voice, broad shoul­ders, and a dis­play of poise and humil­ity that sur­prised and hum­bled me — gave his vale­dic­tory speech and col­lected his high school diploma with his father, older brother, friends, and a few other fam­ily mem­bers in atten­dance. And as I sat in the front row lis­ten­ing to him speak, I was acutely aware that I was expe­ri­enc­ing the end not just of his high school years, but the most mon­u­men­tal chap­ter of my life so far.

I thought the “worst” was over. After all, Matthew cel­e­brated his 18th birth­day last Novem­ber. I felt a lit­tle lost that day, because I real­ized that I was no longer the mother of any minor chil­dren. Although I joked about it with my friends, it was a bit of a jolt. And just a cou­ple of weeks later, the full force of that knowl­edge came into play when Matthew pre­sented me with a field trip per­mis­sion slip. I looked at the sig­na­ture line and real­ized that it no longer held any rel­e­vance for me. “Matthew, you don’t need my sig­na­ture on this form,” I told him. “Mom, they said we have to turn the per­mis­sion slips in tomor­row or we can’t go on the trip,” he replied absent­mind­edly while for­ag­ing in the refrig­er­a­tor. (Some things never change, no mat­ter how old they get.) “How old are you now?” I reminded him. Sud­denly, he got it! “Oh, yeah! I’m an adult now! I don’t need your per­mis­sion! Oh, cool!” he exclaimed, snatch­ing the form away from me. Selec­tive Ser­vice and voter reg­is­tra­tion forms arriv­ing in the mail rein­forced the point.

But there was some­thing about reach­ing the last and most impor­tant mile­stone — high school grad­u­a­tion — that really caused me to pon­der its sig­nif­i­cance for my own life. Not only am I the mother of two adults, I have now ful­filled my parental respon­si­bil­i­ties! As I remind them (light-heartedly, of course) when they argue or fail to per­form a house­hold chore when requested to do so, “Hey, I am no longer oblig­ated to feed you, so if you enjoy liv­ing here, get with the pro­gram! Oth­er­wise, tell me where to for­ward your mail.” There is a sense of achieve­ment asso­ci­ated with hav­ing suc­cess­fully raised two boys, both of whom grad­u­ated from high school with hon­ors, and are law-abiding cit­i­zens. Matthew was inter­viewed by the local news­pa­per about how it felt to be the vale­dic­to­rian of his class. He said, “I feel really accom­plished.” I con­fess that I couldn’t help feel­ing “really accom­plished” myself when I read the arti­cle, which con­cluded as fol­lows: “When asked who he would thank above all oth­ers for help­ing him become suc­cess­ful, the school’s top stu­dent said ‘def­i­nitely’ his mother. ‘She gave me a kick in the pants when I needed it and made sure I didn’t goof around,’ he said.”

Unlike some women who reach this junc­ture in their lives, I do not need to ask myself how I am going to fill the hours freed up by less­ened parental respon­si­bil­i­ties. I have so many inter­ests and hob­bies, includ­ing a renewed ded­i­ca­tion to my flute stud­ies, that I never worry about being busy enough. How­ever, I have done some mourn­ing for the lit­tle boys my sons once were — and will never be again — and the fact that they will never need me in the same way that they once did. I’m sure that melan­cho­lia rolls over every par­ent from time to time as they, and their chil­dren, get older. The hap­pi­est moment of my day used to be when I would sneak into the preschool or house and watch them play­ing hap­pily, com­pletely unaware that I had arrived. Look­ing up and see­ing me, they would yell, “Mama’s here!” Toys and friends were instantly for­got­ten as they ran to me, want­ing to be picked up and hugged! Matthew, in par­tic­u­lar, had a habit of smooching my whole face as he grabbed it with his adorable, but very dirty, lit­tle fin­gers. I would love to have some of that dirt on my cheeks again. But I will set­tle for the bear hugs that remind me of just how much time has passed when I find my nose smashed into his shoul­der as he tow­ers over me!

There was lit­tle time to feel maudlin or wal­low in sen­ti­men­tal­ity, how­ever. After all, the new chap­ter of Matthew’s life as an adult — and mine, as the uncon­di­tion­ally sup­port­ive (finan­cially and in all other ways) par­ent — began on June 7, just four days after grad­u­a­tion. That morn­ing, he stepped onto the cam­pus of the com­mu­nity col­lege from which his older brother and I both grad­u­ated to attend the first ses­sion of his first-ever col­lege course, Polit­i­cal Sci­ence. And that evening, I took him to pur­chase sup­plies. As he pre­pared his back­pack for the next morn­ing, I asked him if he had his text­book, binder, pen­cils, etc. Finally, he looked at me exas­per­at­edly, and a blurted out, “Mom, stop! I’m not a baby! I’m grown up! I’m in col­lege!” The rebuke stung for a moment. But then I real­ized that he was right. So I qui­etly went into the other room and left him to fig­ure out for him­self whether he was pre­pared for his sec­ond day as a col­lege fresh­man, mut­ter­ing to his brother, who over­heard and was laugh­ing, “Well, that didn’t take long. He’s only been in col­lege less than twelve hours.” But his remarks typ­ify the spirit of inde­pen­dence I worked to instill in him and will serve him well over the course of the next four years as he works toward the next mile­stone, another grad­u­a­tion. Another oppor­tu­nity for his mother to feel proud, hum­bled, and at a cross­roads of my own.

But in the mean­time, he still asks the same ques­tion he has been ask­ing since he learned to speak. “Mom, what’s for din­ner?” So, in many ways, the old cliches are true. You never stop being a par­ent — and a mother’s work is never really done.



He sat in an over-sized chair in the liv­ing room wear­ing bib over­alls. One leg crossed over the other, his ankle rested on the oppo­site knee. He wore men’s clas­sic style leather slip­pers and the bot­toms of his pant legs were folded up form­ing cuffs. Every so often, he flicked the ashes from his ever-present cig­a­rette into the cuff of the pant leg perched on his knee. It seemed such a bizarre rit­ual to me and, although I never asked, I won­dered why my grand­mother tol­er­ated it.

He said very lit­tle. As I think back on those vis­its now, I have no rec­ol­lec­tion of him ever directly address­ing me, and yet I tell myself that he must have at least asked me how I was, how things were at school … But I can­not clearly hear his voice in my head. All I remem­ber is that he was soft-spoken and as I sat uncom­fort­ably on the couch across the room from him, I noted the resem­blance my father bore to him and won­dered if, as my father aged, he too would be bald.

I don’t remem­ber the day we learned that he had lung can­cer. But I do recall that there came a point when I was no longer to required to accom­pany my par­ents when they vis­ited him in the con­va­les­cent hos­pi­tal where he was spend­ing his last days. One night, they returned and told us that he had died while they were sit­ting at his bed­side. He was in a coma. My mother relayed that, as she gazed at him lying in the bed, she real­ized he was not breath­ing and alerted my father. The med­ical per­son­nel con­firmed that he was gone.

I was in the fourth grade and his was the first funeral I ever attended. My par­ents talked about the logis­tics in advance, so I knew that there would be two areas in which atten­dees would be seated. We would be in the larger of the two rooms, rather than on the couches in the lit­tle room off to the side where the rest of his fam­ily would gather. My father made it clear that he would be dri­ving us to the ser­vice at the funeral home and, after­ward, the ceme­tery, in his own car. We would not be join­ing his rel­a­tives in the funeral home’s limousine.

Frankly, the image of that old, bald man lying in the cas­ket is more vivid to me than all of the vis­its we paid to him in his home com­bined. I remem­ber think­ing how odd he looked. His face was dif­fer­ent; his skinned appeared waxy and as though it had been pulled tightly across his face. His lips were an odd shade of red. But what really stood out was his salmon color, double-breasted suit with the unusu­ally wide lapels. They were com­pletely out of place in 1966 when men, includ­ing my father on that cold Jan­u­ary day, wore dark suits with one row of but­tons and nar­row lapels.

I sat on the pew next to my father while a man I didn’t know talked about the man lying in the cof­fin behind him, whom I had never really known, either. Off to the side, I could see the room about which my par­ents had spo­ken and caught glimpses of my grand­mother, aunts, uncles, and cousins through the opaque cur­tain that sep­a­rated us from them.



My par­ents thor­oughly enjoy­ing them­selves while play­ing with my old­est son when he was about two years old.
Although I could not shake the vague sense that I should feel sad, I had no real emo­tional attach­ment to the man in the cas­ket. I had never got­ten the sense that my par­ents did, either, until I looked up at my father and saw him wip­ing tears from his cheek. I had never seen him cry before and it was only then that I real­ized that the man I always called “Daddy” had lost his own father. Still, his emo­tional reac­tion was baf­fling given that we never cel­e­brated hol­i­days or birth­days with any of his fam­ily mem­bers, and the only time we saw my grand­par­ents was when my mother would announce, “Well, I guess we should go visit your par­ents.” My father never said any­thing more than “I sup­pose” in response, but he would duti­fully arise from his recliner and get ready to go. Then we would grudg­ingly pile into the car for the less than one mile jour­ney to their house. We were never offered even a cookie or glass of milk, and usu­ally didn’t even remove our coats. Rather, we sat in silence lis­ten­ing to the grown-ups “visit” for what my par­ents deemed a respectable period of time. And then one of them — usu­ally my father — would announce that “we’d bet­ter be going.” We would trek back to the car, come home, and savor the relief that accom­pa­nies the knowl­edge that you have per­formed some type of duty. Until the next time, that is.
When my friends talked about their grand­fa­thers, I was awestruck. I won­dered why I was not blessed with grand­par­ents who invited me to spend the night at their house, take me on adven­tures with them, bake birth­day cakes for me or do any of the myr­iad other things that grand­par­ents usu­ally love doing with and for their grand­chil­dren. To this day, I don’t fully under­stand why we were, for all intents and pur­poses, estranged from my father’s fam­ily, although I gleaned bits and pieces of their dys­func­tional his­tory from my mother over the years. My father said pre­cious lit­tle about it, although his actions spoke vol­umes. I wish now that I had asked him more ques­tions about his feel­ings when I had the chance. His thoughts on the mat­ter are for­ever lost to me.

But that’s one of the rea­sons why I decided to return to Lodi after spend­ing a few years liv­ing in other parts of Cal­i­for­nia. I rea­soned that if I ever had chil­dren, I wanted them to live near their grand­par­ents and enjoy the kind of rela­tion­ship with them that I never had the oppor­tu­nity to expe­ri­ence. I antic­i­pated that my par­ents would be involved, lov­ing grand­par­ents and I was absolutely right. In fact, I used to watch them inter­act­ing with the boys and jok­ingly ask, “Who are you peo­ple and what have you done with my par­ents?” To say that they doted on their pre­cious grand­sons would be an under­state­ment. They seemed vir­tu­ally reborn after their first grand­child, my old­est nephew, Paul, arrived.
