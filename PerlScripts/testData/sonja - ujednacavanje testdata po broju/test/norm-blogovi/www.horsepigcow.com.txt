After having coffee with a male friend today, I came home and changed some of the information I share with my “friends” on Facebook. I felt incredibly conflicted doing this.
The context of our conversation was the following: I’ve been asked out at a fairly normal, even healthy rate, by men I meet while out and about, but as soon as they ‘friend’ me on Facebook, there seems to be an extreme amount of vanishing going on. According to my male friend, my level of disclosure is too much for most men to stomach (in his words, men want “mystery” or at least to think that there is a challenge to getting a girl’s number and information). Of course, my reaction was that any man that couldn’t handle a few foursquare check-ins and posts about my son and life on FB wouldn’t be man enough to deal with me anyway, so good riddance. However I wondered in the back of my mind if removing my phone number and tightening up the privacy settings just a wee bit wouldn’t hurt anyway.
As I did this it occurred to me that there was a new ‘class’ of women emerging in the world. When I open up FB, most of the posts talking about personal lives, posting whereabouts and having deep discussions about sex and modern love are by the women I have as friends on FB. Many of them single. Most of them list their contact information, including phone number. The number of posts by women seem to be far greater than those by men – and I have more male ‘friends’ than female by far (it’s the circles I run in). And this seems consistent with some of the most recent research about who is participating on social networks (more women). Only a few years back, though, it seemed to be the opposite.
Only 3 years ago, it seemed that women were more closed in their use of social web tools:
Women Who Tech Presentation: Women, Technology and Social Capital

Women were keeping their Twitter accounts private, their Facebook accounts only open to close friends and they certainly weren’t joining the social networks that broadcast location at a major rate. I’m not sure what the percentage is, but it does appear that women are dropping the “women need to be private for safety” line in exchange for the “women need to be public for success” line. At least in my circles.
Recently, this article came out proclaiming that, well, we as women don’t really “need” men anymore as we are earning more money, more educated and have the majority of the buying power now. Hell, we don’t really even need them to make babies thanks to modern science. My favorite line in the entire article is:
Guys, one senior remarked … “are the new ball and chain.”
Still, as I remarked to my friend (who thought I repeated the line “I don’t *need* a man” too many times to be a neutral statement), I would like to have a healthy, long term relationship with a man, so I’m trying to get to the bottom of the vanishing problem (and vanishing before I can even have an IRL date). As he put it, “You probably don’t want to be dating normal men anyway.”
Bingo. “The normals” is a term I’ve heard come up more and more lately. At one point it was used to describe non-early-adopter types that you want to attract to your startup. At some point, it became people who don’t ‘get’ our crazy social web lifestyle. The lifestyle where we are recording every moment, happening, thought and occasion in some sort of digital form and quite often broadcasting it to everyone. It is quite addictive, really, especially when it is so full of every day rewards: increasing your friend base (geographically as well as numerically), getting you hired to teach others to do this stuff, small bits of fame here and there and interesting moments every day. Broadcasting and connecting with other broadcasters becomes a way for life to get super interesting quickly. It isn’t trivial, either. The knowledge I accumulate through my random conversations daily has made me dangerous at a cocktail party. Who needs to read the paper anymore when we pass around articles before they are published and dissect them as a collective?
“The Normals” who are part of those conversations are left in our opinionated dust. In our crazy social web world, we gain one another’s respect by our deep analysis of social issues. In the ‘normal’ world, we are seen as complete airbags. But there is nothing wrong with our neverending quest for knowledge or desire to share every bit of that knowledge accumulated (being the awesome knowledge brokers we are), it’s just, well, a little abnormal…for ‘normal’ people.
And it’s worse for women. A man who knows lots of stuff, shares it and gets excited by this knowledge is seen by most as industrious, ambitious and smart. Not all women, but many women see this man as attractive and someone with great earning potential. A woman who exhibits a keen desire to share knowledge (for instance, to talk about data, the future of economics and the changing socio-cultural climate) on the other hand is really ONLY seen as attractive by men who are excited by those conversations. For male “Normals”, this woman is emasculating at best.
It’s a stereotype stuck in another era, really. As the presence of women as the leaders in the workforce grows, it will be more an more crucial for women to be knowledgeable and ready to share and strut that knowledge. And not only will it be necessary for our professional lives, but, hell, it will become apparent that knowledge is freakin awesome, so we will want to pursue more of it. At some point, “The Normals” will occupy the minority, too, because survival will be directly tied to our knowledge and ability to share it…but that’s a whole other post.
I knew there was a reason that I’ve found nerds sexier than jocks and rockstars as I’ve grown older (and wiser). They seem to understand that holding her own in a debate on the future of nuclear energy or whether China is the next superpower is the sexiest thing a woman can do and that a woman who blogs, posts her geo-location and scours the web for interesting articles to post on her FB profile is just being smart about her data. The mystery that turns nerds on is in figuring out how to read between the lines of her Twitter stream, how to decode the latest Blip.fm playlist to find out how she really feels about you and looking at her Flickr favorites to understand how she wants to see the world around her. Love is knowing that she shares what is happening with thousands of people, but her innermost fears with only you.
So I maintain that a man who asks for my number but cannot handle my level of disclosure is not the man for this modern woman. And I’m afraid it’s his dating pool, not mine, that is getting smaller.


’m ashamed to say that, for many years, I’ve used both to describe the wrong thing. CEO of what? I was the sole employee (or there were two of us who were partners in the case of Citizen Agency). Sure, I managed projects, bringing together bright people who worked on great campaigns and products, but at the end of the day, we were all just a group of independent contractors temporarily coming together to create something that we usually didn’t have a huge stake in. There was little risk, just a lot of creativity. We assumed the fun role while the client assumed the risk.
There is no startup without a product. There is no CEO without assuming risk: for reputation, money, other people’s welfare (employees), answering to investors, etc. (all the things that O’Dell mentions in her list for entrepreneurs and more) I’m discovering rapidly that this type of work – having a startup and being in the real role of CEO is very different than anything I’ve done before.
Startup, I’m in love.
I love one minute knowing with intense certainty that what we are onto is something HUGE and will ultimately change the world, then the next minute wondering if I have delusions of grandeur and should be treated for Schizophrenia. But this is a common and desirable theme amongst founders (especially startup ones) I’m told. Either way, I’m happy and loving it and learning quite a bit about why leadership is not for everyone and is definitely important. Here are just a few things I’ve learnt in the past few weeks:
A leader sets the pace of an organization. When asked what I most love about my freelance lifestyle, I’d always say, “I can sleep in”. And I did. In fact, I banished the existence of alarm clocks from my life, only using the alarm on my mobile phone if I absolutely HAD to catch an early plane. No more. If I roll into the office late every day (if at all), others notice. Their pace matches mine. I’ve changed all of that. My alarm goes off at 6:30 am and I am up without hitting the snooze button right away. I aim to be the first person in the office every day. I should be.
A leader isn’t afraid to make unpopular decisions. I used to ask everyone else what they thought instead of making a real decision. I was afraid to decide anything that would impact someone else in a negative way. It made me popular and liked, but very ineffective. I’ve been making quite a few unpopular decisions and, guess what? Not everyone likes them, but the end result thusfar? So far, so good. Signing up for TechCrunch Disrupt and pushing the team towards launching there was one of them. Best decision ever. Completely nuts and unpopular.
A leader has to understand every part of the business. Every part. This one makes me cringe and whine. Every part? OMG I hate spreadsheets and those gawdawful buzzwords around funding (term sheets, run rate, valuation, etc)! My eyes glaze over when talking about hosting and technology infrastructure. I struggle with what is front end and back end. I love data, but am a little confused when it comes to database architecture. So. Much. To. Know. But I have to. I have to at least have a decent understanding of all of these things. I can’t show up to a meeting without answers. Playing dumb isn’t allowed. Leadership means I have a good sense of how all the moving parts of my business works, even if I don’t make them move myself. This will take a while.
A leader asks for help. I’ve always been pretty good at surrounding myself with strong people, but where I fall down is actually asking for help. I think a part of me is afraid that if I ask for help, it’ll signal I don’t know what I’m doing. Of course, I know that’s a backwards way to look at it and good leaders ask for help. It helps me learn what I need to learn (see previous point).
A leader knows when NOT to lead. You know the feeling – you think, “I’ll just do it myself. It’ll be easier and done right.” Well, that kind of attitude will send a strong signal to the team member in charge of that role that you don’t value their work. And there isn’t anything more demotivating than that. Being a DIY girl, I have to consciously NOT do this. It’s not about delegation, it’s about empowering people to take charge on their own. Sure, I may know lots about a certain area, but I also have to trust that my team mates know their stuff, too. And trust, well, that’s the biggest lesson of all.
There are more lessons than that to come. I’ve only been in this role for a short while. But I’m learning quickly and finding out that leaders DO lead, they just lead with a good balance of being IN the lead (as in setting the example or being knowledgeable) while getting out of the way to let others lead (as in asking for help and letting others take responsibility for their roles). And it isn’t always easy to figure out when to do what.
Wish me luck.


There is something about a new year…
This year I’m traveling to New York for New Years, partially for work and partially to catch up with my friends there. I really look forward to just hanging out in one of my favourite cities for an entire week with no real agenda. It seems like a perfect thing to do to reflect on everything.
And reflect I will. The photoshopped image attached to this post is how I’ve been feeling for most of 2010. Constant pressure. “Nearly almost verging on just about approaching bordering on *egad* just a little more and I’ll have that ring!” is my first and last thought of the day. Don’t get me wrong. I’ve achieved quite a bit. And grown even more! But as I was telling someone the other day, this is the first really hard thing I’ve ever done. I’ve done hard things. I’ve been through loads of challenges. Doing a startup takes the cake.
And let me qualify that even more. Building a product is challenging, but not the really hard part. It takes time and it’s never quite right. You make a million mistakes. And the stuff you think will be awesome actually isn’t. But I’ve done this within organizations. I’ve worked directly on product. I’ve tweaked and tested and planned and launched before. I’ve worked on everything from wireframes to design to UX. I’ve got it right and wrong. It’s the fun part of a startup. And I’ve worked on the community building/marketing end of things, too. That, too, is a challenge. People are busy and don’t care about your messaging, etc. But I’m good at bridging building something with meaning to match people’s desires. And I’ve gained an amazing group of supporters over the years who are really patient when I screw up.
So, yeah. Building a product and selling a product is challenging, but well within my abilities. The Frodo-photo was imagined in the past month or so as we look for funding. I’ve built businesses before. Small but profitable, sustainable businesses. I’ve never had to seek outside funding (other than a line of credit). Building a startup usually requires outside capital. And, well, we are no exception to this rule. We’ve spent the year, all of our savings and some generous loans from friends and family bootstrapping Shwowp. We held out as long as we could from pounding on those doors. There is a good reason why. This shit is heartbreaking. I used to think there was nothing more frustrating than dating. I was wrong.
Let me set the scene:
You make a connection, prepare a pitch and demo, have a great meeting filled with amazing ideas, you shake hands and they utter the words, “Next steps.” You leave with butterflies in your stomache. You liked them a LOT. They GOT it. You dream of not only being able to pay your rent next month, but how they would be great additions to your board with their experience and connections. You send an upbeat follow up email.
And then they don’t call. They don’t write. And your heart sinks into your stomache.
So you cheerfully type another follow up: “Let’s explore those next steps you talked about!” And the airwaves are silent.
Then comes the part where you start beating yourself up. “Is it ME? Did I say something wrong? Did I come across incompetent? Not realistic enough? Should have I worn the blue dress instead? Maybe it was a tweet? Or maybe I tweet too much and they think I’m not committed? Maybe I should write an email explaining that my tweets are part of the overall marketing. Staying on top of things. Maybe I should stop tweeting. Could it be the product? Yeah, it’s pretty early on and we’re super beta. But they realized that. They *said* it looked like a great start. They understand that we can iterate quickly…especially if we can hire another developer. They understand we’ve built quite a bit on very little. Right?”
And so on. Instead of focusing on the product and the community, you are sitting there fretting over how a promising meeting turned into radio silence. Or worse…the soft rejection, which I’m sure is a standard gmail template for VCs and Angels, “Great team, great product, but we are passing due to where we are at and where you are at right now. But keep in touch as you progress. We’d like to talk more in the future.”
Facepalm. What happened?!
You give yourself pep talks. Read blog posts from other CEO’s that tell you they talked to hundreds of potential investors before they got to a yes. Hundreds?! The dozen or so you are talking to are already shortening your lifespan.
Yeah. So that’s kind of my every day right now. Yes. It sounds a lot like dating. But at least I can AVOID dating!
Don’t get me wrong. I will go through this pain as long as I need to in order to build my dream. I don’t give up easy and I love the people I’m working with and how the product is evolving. I’m so excited about how fast we are progressing (launched in 6 months and improving significantly every week). I got giggly tonight on Tummelvision.tv talking about an upcoming bookmarklet we will be releasing. I’ve never been known to throw in the towel when it comes to hard work.
Dammit. 2011 is the year I grab that motherf&*)ng ring. I’ll get to put the focus back on building an amazing product and user base. It’ll still be hard work and there will be many trying days, but I *will* level up and breath a little bit easier than I have for the past few months.
It’s going to be a fantastic year. A year of building and growing and learning and reaping…I will make it to Mordor and destroy that ring and be ready to meet my next big challenge with renewed strength.
What are you shooting for in 2011?
