The new Wegmans at the Woodmore Towne Centre in Glenarden/Lanham/Largo/Mitchellville/Upper Marlboro (did I forget one?) finally opened yesterday morning.



I wasn’t one of the 1,500 people who were there by the 7:00am opening. I got there around 9:15am. Getting there wasn’t a problem. The police were directing traffic at the intersection of St. Joseph’s Drive and Route 202 (Landover Road). But once you got into the shopping center there were plenty of cars and the Wegmans parking lot is huge. Thankfully they had the police and other folks directing traffic within the shopping center as well. While driving I noticed that the Costco gas station was open. Costco opens tomorrow.

The first chore was trying to find a parking space. After driving around I finally found one. The second chore was trying to find a big shopping cart cause I had some serious grocery shopping to do  They had several types of shopping carts and the one I was looking for was difficult to find. That’s how busy they were. I finally followed an employee who was putting a cart back.

I usually do my grocery shopping at Giant on Saturdays but since Wegmans was opening I decided to wait until yesterday. Once I got in, OMG I was in awe. Wegmans is huge. And of course it was so crowded you really had to maneuver your shopping cart around so you wouldn’t run into other shoppers. I was a very patient person since I got there early and took my time getting around the store. I tried to go down as many aisles as I could but that was somewhat difficult due to the crowds. I did notice that the produce area was one of the most crowded. But I made my way through so I could buy my greens  They had regular and organic greens.

The Food Bar areas were even more crowded than the grocery area. The Food Bar areas include the Asian Bar, Vegetarian Bar, Fresh Food Bar, Veggie Bar, places that sell pizza, subs, sushi and coffee, the prepared food area and the Market Café. I did try out the Asian food bar and the food was very good.

There were quite a number of grocery items I bought that were cheaper than the prices at Giant. Uh oh!!! I was glad to see that they had a variety of brands including name brands and Wegmans brand. Overall I really enjoyed my shopping adventure even if it was extremely crowded. I was there for over an hour. I’m hoping that next time I go there which will probably be this Saturday it won’t be as crowded as opening day. That way I can really take my time, go down every single aisle and check out the areas that I missed out on yesterday including the Seafood area. I’m gonna try my best to stay away from the bakery area but that might be a difficult task
The Woodmore Wegmans is located at 9001 McHugh Drive in Lanham, Maryland. If you’re taking the Beltway take Exit 17A to Landover Road (Route 202 East). You will make a left at the first light which is St. Josephs Drive.

I opened up my Washington Post this morning and saw a flyer for the grand opening of the Woodmore Towne Centre at Glenarden. The flyer mentioned the grand opening on Friday October 22, 2010.  Besides Wegmans, Costco, Best Buy and Petco there will also be a Sleepy’s, Hour Eyes, Noodles and Company, PNC, Subway, T-Mobile and many others.  J.C. Penney is scheduled to open in the Spring of 2011.  This ad was also on the back page of today’s Washington Post Express newspaper.



I also checked out the Petrie Ross Ventures website where you can see a site map of the new shopping center. Check it out here. You need Adobe Acrobat to see the site map. Just go to Detailed Information in the right column, scroll down and you will see Complete Media Package. Click on the link and you’ll see a sixteen page marketing package including the site map. I enlarged it to about 400% so I could read the names of some of the stores and restaurants since the lettering is very small for some of the retail stores. There are alot of nameless restaurant spots.  Some of the eating establishments listed include Sam Louie (a pizzeria), Noodles & Company (I love that place), Irie Cafe, a Vietnamese restaurant and Subway. Other stores listed include Beauty Mart, Party City, Woodmore Wine Store, Super Spa and Nails, Old Navy, Centre Cleaners, Capri (never heard of this place), Ultimo (never heard of this place) and plenty of other nameless retail spots. There’s also a police/security area (thank goodness) and several banks.  And lets not forget that there is plenty of parking.

On the bottom left of the site map under site data I saw Fitness mentioned that’s over 45,000 square feet (almost the same size as Best Buy). I’m wondering if a fitness center like Bally’s or some other fitness place will be there.

Woodmore Towne Centre looks like what many folks thought The Boulevard was gonna be.  A really nice shopping center.  Well we all know how The Boulevard turned out.  The riff raff took over that shopping center.  The Boulevard is located next to the Largo Town Center metro which many folks say is part of the problem.  Woodmore Towne Centre is located a few miles from the Largo Town Center metro.  That would be one serious walk on Lottsford Road, Route 202 and then St. Josephs Drive.  Hopefully the riff raff will stay put at The Boulevard and Woodmore Towne Centre will be a nice, safe shopping center for the rest of us.


Last Saturday I decided to drive over to Woodmore Towne Centre to see what’s going on.  I read that the new Best Buy is open. That’s the only store that’s open right now. When I got over to the Woodmore Towne Centre it looked like construction city. They’re still doing alot of work over there.  I did see that there’s gonna be a Petco store there. Other than that there’s not much driving around you could do.  They’ve got construction workers blocking most of the driving area with the exception of getting into the Best Buy parking lot.

I did go into the Best Buy and looked around. It’s nice, spacious and it’s huge. I also bought a new pair of ear plugs for my mp3 player since my old pair died on me last Friday.

I saw a one page ad in the Prince Georges Gazette that the new Costco will be opening on Tuesday October 26. Two days after the Wegmans grand opening which takes place next Sunday October 24.

Speaking of Wegmans I received this flyer in the mail.

I received my shoppers club card in the mail a few weeks ago. I applied as soon as I saw the first Wegmans ad in the back of the Washington Post Sunday Arts section last month. Check out the Wegmans Woodmore Grand Opening page at the Wegmans website here.

And there’s more news.  According to the site Citybizlist, the grand opening of the Woodmore Towne Centre is Friday, October 22.
