Before I forget and before I go to sleep, I got to write down some things to do and remember for tomorrow. One of those is to remind my dear hubby that we should probably look for those kitchen sinks that will be amon our choices on our plan to fix the kitchen sink at my parents' house. 

One of my sisters has pledged to finance that home improvement project that we thought my mom would really appreciate us attending to since she is the one who is often at the kitchen and often using the kitchen sink at home. Before I forget too, I got to talk to my mom again tomorrow about some details on this project which we hope to have done by early next year.

It's rather late at night around here and my eyes seems to be shutting down on its own even before I could shut down my laptop. I started to feel sleepy when the rain started pouring outside a few hours ago. I was still looking for a plantation shutter for a possible replacement for the little boy's window. 

We want to have some more natural light come into the room during the day. Yet the little boy does not like too much light coming into the room. A friend actually told me about this kind of shutter that is made of high quality custom made wood shutter that is said to let you save energy during winter and summer. Let's talk some other time on this shutters while my mind seems to be shutting down right now.

December has just stepped in and yet it is not too early to plan for next year. One of our plans is to work harder so we can save more and explore some means to be able to make an investment. Starting at a little investment may go on a long way and hopefully grow over the next few years.

Thinking of the United States Gold Bureau United States Gold Bureau which time and again is something that reminds me it is good to take investment seriously. My sister once told me about coming across the Wall Street Journal and WSJ says Buy Gold. A sound and solid financial advice for serious investors. So if you do have plans next year to invest, you may want to think about making precious metal investments.

I always believe anyone who takes the wheel and drives on any road in Houston, Texas or wherever in the world you may be should, drive carefully. Drivers should know the risks and responsibilities that lies in their hand when they drive on the road. A drunk driver has no right to be on the road.
Being caught driving drunk is a serious matter that should be handled well for example by those Houston DWI lawyers who can help work out a solid defense for you just in case you are caught by the police to be driving with influence or what they also call DWI. So it is best for driver not to drink when they plan to drive after. It is called being responsible for your life and other people's lives who are traveling on the road just like you. The lesson here is to always drive carefully.

What do you cook when home alone? ::: Very simple or easy to cook dishes. Sometimes pasta salad.

What is something you'd like a chance to eat or cook? ::: Japanese food and dishes since I am not really a fan of it but I'd like to try tasting it one day. 
What is your favorite cookbook? ::: No particular or specific favorite cookbook that I can think of now. Will let you know when I have one already.

The last two years have seen terribly low volumes of post Thanksgiving shopping in America. What with the recession and all, many simply gave up on shopping these two years, and Thanksgiving lost a lot of its fun.

This year, though, people are expecting a lot of shopping. Retailers are expecting a greater return to the good old days before the recession when all of America came out on the streets to buy gifts for family and friends.

Like before, people will not worry about spending too much. There is a new hope for a better economy, despite forebodings from the experts. Americans will be taking out payday loans, if necessary, to do their shopping after Thanksgiving, and may depend on Payday One to make their Thanksgiving shopping meaningful.

So, what are you going to buy this post Thanksgiving sale? For those who can afford it, this Thanksgiving will be a good time to give the gift of gold. Yes, gold is at its all time high price right now. Buying gold is always good in the long term. It acts as a hedge against recession, it can be quickly liquidated during emergencies, and the glittering metal looks beautiful too.

People like to give all kinds of gifts, but there are some that are better planned hence thoughtful than others. One of the more thoughtful gifts - again, as long as you can afford it - is to arrange a vacation, all expenses paid, for people you love. You can arrange to fly your parents on a vacation to Tahiti or Mexico, or a trip through continental Europe. 

Whatever you do, put a lot of thought into your gift and it will certainly be memorable.

Though I find them immensely beautiful, I have decided to not splurge on a Chopard necklace this year. These are some of my favorite pieces of jewelry. Instead, though, I plan to spend some extra money on others in my family for the holidays. Generally, I take a little extra money each Christmas and get something special for myself. Not this year. 

Not only am I planning to get better presents for my loved ones, I have also decided to put some money toward charity. Deciding on the charity, though, has been difficult. Eventually, I decided on a charity called Child's Play. This is a fairly new charity; it has only been around since about 2003. 

What exactly do they do? Well, this charity donates things like video games and movies to children's hospitals. These items are meant to help make the days a little easier and brighter for the children that are having to stay in these hospitals. Being a kid in a hospital is a sad enough thing in and of itself. Being able to contribute to making life a little happier for these kids is something that I have been interested in doing for a while. 

I'm happy that this year I am not spending the extra money on myself. Sure, it's great to have a little extra, but being able to help out those who are really in need is so much better than spending tons of money on jewelry for myself.

I told some of my friends about this. They agree that it is a great idea, and are all finding a charity that they are interested in and are donating to it. The more people that do this, the better off our world will be. Being able to help those that need it is what Christmas is all about.

It is that time of the year again; time to buy presents for the women in your life. The Christmas gifts on every woman's list varies from woman to woman and year to year. Every woman is as unique as the gifts that she requests. From jewelry to perfume, cameras to software, fur coats to shoes; the gifts on her list can be found. Sometimes it just takes a little shopping around or asking the store clerk for help, and if you're lucky you might find them all right at your fingertips on the Internet. 

Avoid clothing, no matter what it is. Women will almost always find something wrong with it. Know your lady well enough to know what she would purchase for herself and what she might like that is romantic. Maybe she has an old camera that should would like replaced with higher pixels for a better picture quality. An old comforter that needs replaced or a stereo with iPod accessories, these are all personal and great ideas that any woman would appreciate.

When buying perfume, go with something soft, romantic and subtle. If possible, try to figure out what scent she already wears, but whatever you do don't get a fragrance that is overpowering. Ask the clerk what scents are popular, and if the clerk is a woman, ask her what she might recommend. 

Gift cards for spa treatments or massages are always a welcome gift, and they are something that most women would love to receive. Especially if the gift comes with babysitting!

A gift with a bit of a thought behind it will go along way with a woman and the Christmas gifts she receives. Women appreciate it when her partner really thinks about the kinds of things she might like, but if nothing else then these suggestions will help get you started.

Each and every day is filled with numerous activities that simply have to be done. Caring for children, cleaning the house, cooking meals, etc. These activities seem to just eat away at our time and lives. Sure, we don't mind doing them, we even like doing some of them. The point I'm getting at is that sometimes we need to stop caring for others so we can have a chance to care for ourselves. Even if it's just a few minutes a day, we need to be able to have some time to relax, clear our heads, and meet our day head on.

First things first, we need to set aside a time, every single day, where the hubby or any other relative or loved one, can care for your children. You wouldn't want to let your kids run wild while you're trying to have some alone time. After that, make sure that you have a place where you can just be by yourself. Whether you need to completely leave the house or simply lock yourself in a bedroom, find a place to be alone with your thoughts and try to regain a sense of self. 

Next, find an activity that you enjoy doing that is just for you! Whether it be going to a movie, taking a nice bubble bath, or even playing online casino games, do something frivolous just for yourself. 

Lastly, don't just do it once and call it good! Make sure that you have your "you time" on a regular basis. Weekly, monthly, whatever you choose. 

There are so many pressures on us to be the best mother, wife, homemaker, and independant woman. We need to make sure that we are not only caring for others; we need to take care of ourselves along the way as well.
