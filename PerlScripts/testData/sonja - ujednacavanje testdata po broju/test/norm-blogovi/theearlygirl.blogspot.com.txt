When Slim and I were kids, we used to make summer pilgrimages from San Francisco to our dad's house in LA, spending our days at the beach. At the end of each afternoon, glazy-eyed and burnt to a crisp, our dad would park us in front of the TV, with snacks, and he would take a nap. When he stumbled in hours later to find the coffee table covered in potato chip bags, candy wrappers and half-finished sodas, he would ask, "Are these artifacts for a museum?" The script was always the same but Slim and I would howl with laughter.

I thought about this when, like Indiana Jones with a bad case of the forgets, I dug up an e-mail from Ex #1 asking when we could “catch up." I thought of Beautiful Man, seized the moment and answered back with my number.

A few lovely days of talking and reminiscing later, he invited me to visit him at a forest of some kind. He had moved out of the city a few years after we fell out of touch and wanted to take me out on his motorcycle and show me some waterfalls. Desperate for a change of scenery, I packed a bathing suit and before I knew it I was headed north on Highway 5.

Before leaving I had an inkling that he had turned a bit fringe-y. There had been some anti-government speak and Sarah Palin sympathizing (I clutch my pearls, in horror, at the memory) and he was living the hell out in bunker country, so I told my friends that if I wasn’t back on the given day, to come up and get me. I imagined myself in a prairie skirt, draped in children, churning butter and armed to the teeth. “And bring the Feds,” I said.

As it happens, “Ruby Ridge” was actually kind of nice… from the outside. Irises were in bloom and the property was surrounded by Ponderosa Pines and incredible views of still snow-capped mountains. The air was shiny, the oxygen cleaned my lungs and he had a beautiful garden. Once inside the house, however, things took a turn.

I immediately found myself surrounded by dressers of every shape and size, sometimes four to a room. One room had been dedicated to a Foosball table, a pinball machine and a bed. His dining room table sat at such an angle that an apple placed on one end would’ve rolled off the other. As it happens, I needn’t have worried about the table because we wouldn’t be using it. Off of what can only loosely be referred to as a living room, sat another bed and even more dressers. There was a safe filled with gold and silver bars, bullets and guns. If I had to give a name to the style in which the home was decorated, I would go with Early Mental Illness.

After promises of steak dinners and coffee by the fire, I was met, after my 8 1 hour drive, with… string cheese. String cheese. I took what was offered, cause that’s how I was raised, but the whole time I kept thinking, "Really? String cheese?" He ate a raw hot dog out of the fridge while he showed me around his kitchen.

He makes jams and preserves from fruit he grows himself (which is great) but there was enough to make even Martha Stewart wince. Then he showed me his pantry, which was full to bursting with food stuffs in giant boxes. He proudly told me that he had three of everything, “Just in case.”

Me: Just in case (I held my breath) you get snowed in?
Him: No. Because of December 2012.
Me: Please tell me you didn’t go to Costco because of the Mayan Doomsday Calendar.
Him: I sure did, sweetheart (oh, to be called sweetheart again!) and when LA burns to the ground, you’ll be up here looking for peanut butter. Just you watch.

I scanned the house for exits and memorized them.

I was exhausted from the drive and after some more string cheese, I begged off to bed. We hadn’t really committed to the fact that the trip would be romantic and he hadn’t actually kissed me, or anything, so I assumed that meant separate beds. It did not. Turns out, the guest bed was “for sex” and the upstairs bed was for sleeping. I didn't even ask. I just went upstairs.

I was scheduled to be there for 4 days but I knew I would never make it. However, I needed a day to relax so, even though I had more reservations than a Batali restaurant, I asked what was on the agenda. I imagined a quiet day editing manifestos and decoupaging Tea Party signs and I would've gone with it if I'd had to - all I knew was that I couldn't get back in the car again.

In the end, though, we had a ball. He drove me around the country roads at high speed until my stomach did flip-flops. He took me to Wal-Mart to prove, "that I did too look like a model," and show me the Early Girl tomato plants (sigh from sweetness.) We had a romantic meal of chicken wings in a sports bar. He took me on his ATV and drove me through the woods. He collected pine cones for Dash and told me I should bring the kid during the winter and he would show him how to make snow lanterns. I mentioned that I loved the 1980 US/USSR hockey game at Lake Placid and he went next door to the neighbors and got the movie, Miracle, for me to see. It was sweet and surprising and, despite our political differences, his undiagnosed mania and our geographical issues, as dates go, it was one of the better ones.

After a day like that, I assumed, well, I assumed things. We got into bed and after a quick peck on the cheek, he said, "night," turned off the lights and fell asleep. Did I mention I was naked at the time? I was so tired the first night that I barely even noticed we never touched, but this? This was unchartered territory. When I told my friend, Ron, what had happened he said, "Honey, if you were naked in my bed, I would've made a move. No doubt." And Ron's gay.

The next morning I woke up lonelier than I had been before I left and I told my Glenn Beck of the North that it was time for me to go. He said, "Aww. You're bummed." I told him I wasn't bummed, because I am neither 15 nor a surfer, but that it was still time to go. Lonely with someone is far harder than lonely alone. He gave me a hug and a box of preserves. My heart sent "WTF?" texts to my brain on a loop and not long after leaving, so did my colon. I stopped to eat a case of Activia (fucking cheese) and hit the 5 South towards home.

Once there, I got an e-mail from him telling me that his heart sank as he watched me drive away. That he could see us married one day but that scared him, I scared him, and he knew he had blown it. We both wanted so much to fall in love but I can't love a man who's afraid of me and he can't love a woman who happens to like our President. Square peg meet round hole, but nobody blew anything.

There is something that connects us to the one we can't resist. A USB port, if you will, and we just didn't have the right one. He was Mac and I was PC. Or something. Anyway, we just weren't compatible and that's okay. We promised to be friends, both of us knowing that wouldn't work either. The curator of my dad's joke filed him away in the basement of a far-away museum and I sent an e-mail to my other artifact.


About a year ago, I was at the supermarket waiting to pay for my groceries and noticed the woman standing in front of me. It was hard not to. She was stunningly, jaw-droppingly beautiful and all she was buying was a single cucumber. I remember thinking, “Jesus, if she can’t find a man, I’m doomed.” 

I thought of her as I made my way through the produce section the day after Thanksgiving. Normally, I have a very platonic relationship with fruits and vegetables but the first notes of a bye-bye ballad had become too loud to ignore and as I came to the realization that Sam and I were probably through, I thought of the beautiful woman and totally got it. Too distraught to flirt with the cucumbers, I headed toward the more G-rated cereal aisle.

Have you ever wanted to do something you didn’t want to do? That was me and, as I coasted down the aisles looking at everything and nothing in particular, I tried to talk myself into and out of the decision I knew I had to make. I wanted to be unapologetic about what I wanted but that would mean giving up Sam. I wanted to be proud of myself for refusing to settle but I didn’t want to lose someone who made me laugh as hard as he does. I wanted to know that I had learned a thing or two about myself but I would miss the way he looked at me. I wanted to be brave enough to trust that the life I want is possible but I didn’t want to start dating inanimate objects. Again. 

Historically, when I break up with someone, I can see the end long before it’s on the horizon. By the time I start to think, “I want the fuck out of this and can’t stand another second,” I’ve already started packing. It’s dramatic, yes, but it’s clear. Things with Sam and I were a bit muddier. We liked each other a lot, that was a lock, but other lines curved and, most of the time, I didn’t know where we stood. 

Half-way down the frozen section, I realized that knowing where I stand has become pretty important to me and I knew that I had made a decision. Grateful as hell to already be in a supermarket (a place I would’ve careened towards if I had been elsewhere) I stalked the aisles like a great white hunter. I needed fish sticks and a ham sandwich and Corn Pops and Haagen-Dazs and yes, definitely the Raisinets and yes, definitely the spare ribs. It was batten down the hatches time and I wanted to be prepared for the flood of grief. 

After hauling eleventy-seven bags of groceries into the kitchen, I went about break-up proofing the house and the rest of my life: 

1. I took the ticket stubs from The Social Network that I used as a bookmark and threw them away. 

2. I put on Laura Fabian’s I Will Love Again and cranked up the volume. 

3. I called all of my friends and family and told them that I was breaking up with Sam and while I didn’t want them to say anything nasty about him, I did want them to know that I was sending through an approved statement, via e-mail, and they were to stick to the script. “This is all I want to hear from you people,” I said. “Don’t get fancy with it.” The e-mail read: 

“Alex, you are very smart and talented and beautiful and impossibly thin and you are also very brave and interesting and it is shocking that you are not in a relationship. Can I give you some money just to show my utter appreciation for, and confidence in, your remarkable abilities? I’m just going to go ahead and leave it blank and you fill in the amount. Again, this is all very confusing because you are positively extraordinary. I’m speechless. Hope the money helps.”

4. I went to Redbox and rented Eat, Pray, Love (I know, I know) and cleaned the 99 cent store out of Kleenex. 

5. I unfolded a large map of Los Angeles and started Xing out routes and setting up blockades that would make driving down certain streets impossible. As if maneuvering troops into battle or preparing the city for a marathon, I re-mapped how I would get from point A to point B while avoiding the following: 

a.) The street he lives on (a street, btw, I have always used to get from the east side to the west and back again – fuck.) 

b.) The street where "The Restaurant" is (the same restaurant I have been going to for 15 years but after one dinner suddenly became “ours.”) 

c.) The movie theater where we went on our first date and that I could, obviously, never look at again, even though it's on Sunset Blvd which is a, kind of, important street if you want to... I don’t know... go somewhere. 

d.) Tacos Delta, where I first fell for him and which is located on the very corner I turn to go to and from my house. I researched getting airlifted in and out of my neighborhood but it’s pretty expensive. I ordered horse blinders instead. 

6. Because Sam and I had spent a memorable and totally fantastic night with my sister, I called her to say that while I had loved her very much over our 40 years together, I would not be able to see her again. “Too many memories,” I said. We wished each other well and promised to write.
