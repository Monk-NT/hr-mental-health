Time and again I've complained about not making the progress I've desired for my life. I relied on numerous reasons and excuses to justify my delays, but that has ended. When I heard about Rosetta's 31 Days to Reset Your Life Challenge not only is it perfectly timed but also something I have to do. Dragging my feet has cost me, not only monetarily but physically. This became painfully obvious when not one but three business ideas I've had are being brought to fruition by others, one of which has the potential to generate millions. 

Sooooo...needless to say, I don't need yet another bop on the head to realize that all the knowledge, connections, creativity, and resources dwell within me to upgrade my reality, I just need to jump into action starting today!

The challenge kicked off with a couple of easy tasks, one is to choose a mantra. This quote sums things up for me...

I’ve been extremely lazy laid back lately and the need to kick things into gear has taken root with a nagging urgency. These questions crossed my mind this morning....


When my name is mentioned fifty years from now will people ask "who?" or "how did she do it?".

Will I leave my kindred a rich legacy of accomplishments or lessons on how not to live? 

Just something to think about… 


No doubt old style wicker chairs are quite the decorating faux pas these days, but anytime I see one of those splinter-prone garage sale treasures works of art a rush of memories start to flow. Briefly transporting me back to steamy D.C. summer days filled with endless energy, maneuvering my red Big Wheel through the block I reigned over, playing tag and rollerskating, sleepovers, playing outside until the street lights started to glow and Flintstones marathons. Free to be me, a wild child with a flood of novel ideas and seemingly outrageous dreams. Yep, you get the picture, life was easy breezy and those were THE days.

As I passed a row of townhouses during a quick morning drive to clear my weary mind, some kids caught my eye. Girls with plaits and colorful barrettes bossing the boys around (yeah, I did that too...surprised?) and a wicker chair. Seems a regular old chair wouldn't stand out as anything significant or memorable to most people, but it snapped me back to the freedom of my youth. Most importantly, boundless, effortless imagination and not an ounce of hesitation to try the ideas that popped up (no matter how outlandish).

See, in my mind, that chair could've been a Barbie amusement park, supported part of a homemade "tent" or served as a podium for an impromptu reenactment of sorts. Our knack for using ordinary items to create and explore possibilities as a source of entertainment was priceless. These days, at least in my world, it requires blocking out the stress of "grown-up issues" to usher in the freedom of daydreaming and embracing the seemingly ordinary with a fresh perspective. The ultimate result is recognizing and appreciating the value in what others consider as expendable or one-dimensional, breaking the restraints from the world's obscure fence around what's supposedly correct, acceptable, etc.

Somewhere along the way we're taught to color within the lines, align with those around us as a means of avoiding disruption, do as we're told and put away childish things. Only to later realize the real benefit sprouts from accepting that while there are rules, basic expectations and absolutes in this world, allowing our thoughts and ingenuity to flourish like that of our youth is a source of power and happiness that should not be stifled.

How often, if ever, do you allow yourself to take a moment to daydream, explore and create? Try it, you may recognize a familiar ally waiting to be reintroduced into your life.


Talk about a lyrical portrayal of many a failed love story. Seems there is no definite reason why transforming a friendship to an intimate level often winds up being intense and short-lived. A once cherished, admirable connection crumbles leaving one or both wishing it never happened. Life goes on, hearts heal and emotions cool down, but the residual confusion and disappointment remain. 
 
I've experienced the "why not proceed?" stage with a couple of friends and decided it best to maintain our friendship rather than ruin a lifelong connection. This isn't a sly way to reject someone, nothing could be further from the truth. Honestly, this happened when I knew the  affection and attraction I felt was strong and any speed bump would make me immediately retreat. I've pondered whether it's an excuse, protection mechanism, etc. but simply concluded it's just the opposite, to maintain a connection of importance to me. I tend to think women feel this way more often than men when mutual admiration is involved, perhaps they just conceal it better.

I'm not opposed to it because things work out when they're meant to be. Over the years I've gained a better grasp of what I need and want relationship-wise, not to mention what I'm willing to risk to obtain the reward, resulting in a source of clarity rather than a burden. 

No doubt there are a myriad of reasons to leave a good, non-physical connection just the way it is, but have you ever taken the plunge to see what would result? Was it a positive experience (even it didn't last)? Would you do it again?

At what point, if ever, are you totally comfortable allowing the full expression of your emotions (the ups, downs and lulls) to flow when have "love" for a friend of the opposite sex but are not in a relationship? Does it depend on the person? Your own comfort level with expressing emotions? Do you refrain thinking it could tarnish the person's impression of you to expose the nitty gritty?

I’m amazed how downright stubborn I can be. At times this can be a challenge, but lately I’m finding it useful. Specifically when it involves what I desire for my life, how something aligns with my intentions and whether the risk is worth the reward. This doesn't diminish my capacity to be understanding, caring or loving. It actually serves a purpose, one that acts as a buffer for weeding out what's not in my best interest.

Hindsight can be a bitch especially when you realize there were times you overlooked the obvious in hopes of everything aligning perfectly and never even causing you to look back in the first place. My patience has been continually tested and my heart's empty light has been lit a fiery red for countless months, yet it just reinforces the fact that I’m resilient even when faced with less than ideal circumstances. 

I’ve learned to do without love for so long that any inkling of less than one's full effort mixed with ambiguity is a quick left to an emotional pit stop. This isn't such a bad thing because it allows me to see the whole picture, but it can be draining and disappointing. Truth is, I’m too old to compromise on some things and if it means doing without for a little while longer then it's something I'll do.
