I have got to admit, I do have a thing about sunflowers.
The Girlie planted some when we lived in Josselin and they got transplanted when we moved to La Coudrais.
They seem to have taken the move very well!
They seem to be taking over!
Although the photos don’t really show it, the tallest are over 8ft tall!

They seem to have a habit of,well…….
for want of a better phrase, watching you wherever you go!
I know that they’re only flowers but…..
They seem to have a personality all of their own.
I don’t think that I’ll be re-reading Day of the Triffids anytime soon!
The Girlie took this photo late one evening.
I don’t think that the sunflower was very impressed at being woken up to the flash of the camera!
Doesn’t the sunflower look powerful, though?
With the last photo, I’m trying to convey some of the heat that we’ve experienced today.
I haven’t read the thermometer because I don’t need to put a number to one of the hottest days I have ever known (I don’t even remember it being this hot in Turkey!)
The sunflowers seem to be loving it, though. Right up their street!
Next year we plan on planting a whole load more.
The seeds are cheap and they are dead simple to grow. Hopefully we should be able to use some of the seeds for our chickies, when they arrive.
If it would only cool down a bit, I could get on with building their fence!


’ve only ever seen Sunflowers being grown commercially much farther south in France. I didn’t realise that they were also grown in Brittany.
This year, for the first time in the six years that I have been over here, I have seen Sunflowers being grown.
I like Sunflowers!
They seem to have a character unlike that of any other flower.
Perhaps it helps that they are a lot taller than almost every other flower!




 	

 

The Girlie and I first noticed the field a few weeks ago.
We’ve been noting the progress every couple of days.
Yesterday, the Girlie dragged me out to take some photographs – actually, she offered to take me to the bar; we just happened to stop off on the way!
In amongst taking the photos, the farmer came over to tend to his sheep (in the field next door).
It’s been a while since they’ve grown Sunflowers here, he agreed.
The photos don’t really show the immensity of the Sunflower fields.
The whole scale of it is very impressive.
Anyone in the area who wants to take a look, these fields are in Cournon, which is not far from La Gacilly.


Summer has finally arrived at La Coudrais and the garden seems to have realised it.
The cats have settled in to their new home and even survived a De-Fleaing without too many complaints.
And I seem to be trapped in the office trying to get my new business off the ground!
I’ve got a meeting with the Work’s Doctor on Monday and then, 2 weeks later, I should be free! I can’t wait – Siret number has been applied for and business cards have been printed – all I need now are customers!
The Girlie has been busy helping me, as well.
She has been toiling away to come up with the definitive list of every English Speaking Business/Gite/B&B in Brittany. And what a list it is.
All I can say is.. “Boy, do some of you need websites!”
I haven’t told the Girlie that I’ll be after a list of all the French speaking businesses next! Don’t let on, eh?
Whilst the Girlie and I have been slaving away, the garden has kept on growing.
We are hoping that we shouldn’t have to buy tomatoes for a long, long time. From my experience, we’ll be dreaming of tomatoes before the end of the summer!
As well as all the tomatoes, we have blackberries gorwing all over the place.
The Girlie uses these with apples from our own apple tree to make Blackberry and Apple Pie. Am I complaining about this – I should think not!
The Elderberries are another thing. I know that the Girlie has been doing some research into what we are going to do with all the berries.
I’ll just have to wait and see. I do know that Elderberries are full of vitamins – and that can’t be bad!


No sooner have we moved in here at La Coudrais, than the Girlie is digging up stuff that she had planted earlier in the year.
Harvest time – apparently.
I do have to say that her shallots look Lurvely!
I do like a shallot or two!
Actually, her red onions are pretty good as well.
And believe me, they taste as good as they look!
Actually, her red onions are pretty good as well.
And believe me, they taste as good as they look!
Not only has the Girlie been looking after the vegetable garden, she is also keeping La Maison des Fleurs as well stocked as it’s name would suggest.
Cindy has finally decided to take a walk around her new estate – she is catching at least one mousie a day so she seems reasonably happy.
Her brother Sammy was going to have his photo taken as well but…. he was busy sleeping and couldn’t be disturbed!


Joshy seemed to get into the spirit of things quite quickly!
The Girlie (being of the female persuasion), needed some explanation!
This was made slightly more difficult with her constant assertions that she wasn’t ever, for as long as she might live, until hell freezes over, indeed – get anywhere near the merest possibility of even considering putting a worm on the hook – more lessons required there, me thinks!
Thinking that perhaps the reason we weren’t catching anything might have been due to the water level being too low, I decided to help out!
I wasn’t expecting the Girlie (my loved one, or so I thought), to capture the moment for posterity!
Although it is a man’s inalienable right to pee where and when ever he wants to.
I wouldn’t, however, advise trying to do so on a Sunday afternoon when all the world is out for a postprandial stroll!
Finally, the Girlie had a go herself.
At fishing, that is…..
I don’t think that she found the whole exercise quite as disgusting as this photo might imply – her look of disgust was probably due to my suggesting that it was time to change the worm!
I suppose that she must have enjoyed it as much as Joshy as she seems quite keen to have another go!
Obviously – now that we live only a hundred yards from the river, we’re going to have plenty more chances to practise.
We didn’t actually catch anything but had plenty of bites and…
Well, proving that I’m a true fisherman…
You should have seen the size of the one that got away!


Now, I know that it’s the middle of October and that we should be cuddled up in front of the fire but recently the weather has been nice enough for the Girlie and I to be able to spend some time outside and anyway, I don’t have a log fire to cuddle up in front of.
So, that’s how the Girlie and I found ourselves sat in the garden, the other lunchtime, eating a summer holiday meal of bread and cheese and oysters!)
I suppose that normal people would be thinking about winter stews around about now but then, I’m not sure that either the Girlie or I would classify ourselves as normal!






 

It helped that the oysters were on special offer at my local supermarket.
Both the Girlie and I get a buzz out of a bargain!
Perhaps I’m out of touch with what’s going on in England (Briony and Rick kindly brought some U.K. papers over with them when they came over – the country of my birth now seems like a foreign land), but I don’t think that all that many people would be doing something similar in Bognor or Basingstoke!
The Oysters were No2s – this is probably why they were so cheap – the higher the number, the larger the shell – however, the actual oyster inside may well be the same size no matter what size the shell.
No3 Oysters seem to be the most popular (and I am biased but I believe the ones from Cancale taste the best.)
However, sometimes you can get very large oysters (which are a real bugger to open) from the markets at Vannes and Carnac – these are great grilled with finely chopped shallots, crushed garlic and grated cheese.
The Girlie has got quite into oysters – I know that she only tried them just to please me (many months ago), but now really enjoys them (with a drop of lemon juice on top), herself.
It’s hard to start eating oysters – after all; who in their right mind would want to eat a living creature that’s swimming in a shell full of sea water and looks something that a plague victim has just deposited onto his hanky?
It is worth persevering though – once you get the taste – well, excuse the pun but… The World’s Your Oyster!
Why is it that food tastes better if it’s eaten outside?
Why does even a simple meal taste like a feast fit for a king, when it’s shared with someone you love?
Why can’t I afford to eat oysters every day?
Don’t answer that last question – the real answer involves words such as smoking, giving up, work, hard, lots of!
Sometimes my landlady goes to Damgan (probably the nearest beach to me) to pick oysters – she like the picking more than the eating and I tend to get the surplus – lucky me!
The Girlie and I are planning to move into a house in Josselin in the near future – we’ll have to make sure we have an oyster eating table outdoors – so that any spilt seawater doesn’t matter and so that we can just chuck the empty shells onto the shell pile (ready to be crushed up and given to anyone who has chickens – apparently they like crushed shells to help them digest their food!)
Joshy (the Girlie’s son), ate his first oyster, the other day (with a shallot vinagerette), and seemed to enjoy it.
I hope that he doesn’t get to enjoy them too much, too soon as I’m not too keen to sell any body parts (if I’ve got any that are worth anything) – just to finance my new family’s seafood bill!
I’ll leave you with this last photo? what else can I say, other than….. Bon appetite!
