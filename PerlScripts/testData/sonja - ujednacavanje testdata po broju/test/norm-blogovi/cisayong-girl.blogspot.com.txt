My veggie garden is not the spectacular ones like some of the garden in Pohnpei, after seeing two awesome veggie gardens at the US residence compound I feel ashame about my veggie garden which just contain of  eight pots and two small patch gardens.

But anyhow I just harvest my first beans last week, well it actually force harvest because the trees look dying from the bleach's smell the workers used to clean up the outside part of the house.


not bad from just one tree eh

Just one lettuce looks promising and the rest look sad, it won't grow tall I don't know why. But my brocolli, capsicum, parsley and mint look promising. I try to grow more basil by cut the stem and grow it in different places. And since I got more seeds from Louise so I have decided to be more serious in gardening, I just need to get more pots or maybe even utilize available patches and spots around the house.


Since Halloween is not a big thing in Indonesia and Australia so I never went to one, I guess recently people in Jakarta are celebrating Halloween holiday just like in America as I saw some of my friends Halloween photos in facebook. 

We were excited to finally experience Halloween holiday in Pohnpei, although it was a bit of challenge to find the costumes that we want. We went to Super Savers on Thursday to look for costume but no luck, so we settle with what we have in our wardrobe.

Me in school girl outfit.


But I was impressed with the turn up on the party because they were so creative and amazingly they managed to get it done in a small island like Pohnpei, well done guys.

It's relative easy to drive in Pohnpei, everyone drives really slow and the fastest speed limit is 25miles/hour but people mostly drive 20miles/hour, the school zone speed limit is 15miles/hour with caption if children around, so when there are no children around the school you can actually speed up a little bit. You can tell if the driver has been drinking sakau because one will drive really slow, yes it's like 5miles/hour slow.

But driving in Pohnpei can be really tricky because we drive on the right side of the road like in America, so came from Indonesia and Australia where we drive on the left side of the road it takes a while for me to get used to driving in Pohnpei. But most of the cars here are Japanese cars so it's right hand drive including our car which just arrived yesterday. For me is easier like this because I used to drive a right hand drive car so I just need to get used to with driving on the right side of the road. I just have to remember that when I'm driving my side is on the gutter side not the other way around. But for mr. husband is kinda tricky because he has to drive the office car everyday to go to work which has left hand drive and switch to right hand drive car on personal car, but I thinks he gets the hang of it.



Other thing about driving in Pohnpei is that all cars only have one number plate and mostly they put it at the back of the car, I don't know the real reason for this.




Oh yes, finally our car has arrived from Japan. It took about a month from payment until it arrives and I'm so excited because I don't like taking taxi in Pohnpei. The taxi service is not exclusive for us, meaning I can be in the taxi with 3 other strangers and I have to go to their destination first before the driver takes me home. Yeah, I don't like the idea of sharing taxi with 3 strangers especially men. Everyone said it's safe but I just don't like it. Other option to get around is by walking, but walking on the steamy and humid 30 degrees celcius is not a pleasant experience. Well you can say that I'm a princess or a spoiled bratt but I choose not to walk because there are lots of dogs on the street and I'm scared of dogs. One has right to choose whatever one wants, no?

Driving in Pohnpei means one thing for me: FREEDOM!

I feel more alive when the car arrives, that means I don't have to wait for mr. husband if I want to get something from the shop or ask him to drive me to my book club meeting every Wednesday night, I can just drive whenever I want, I drive around to take photos, and I can pick up mr. husband at work to have lunch date like today.

I drive more than mr. husband when we were in Jakarta and Canberra because I like driving and I think I'm a better driver than him, well I don't think he's agree with me on that :p

I have been driving since I was 16 years old, however the legal driving age in Indonesia is 17 years old. Don't ask me how can I get away with that. There are no road rules in Indonesia beside traffic lights green yellow and red, well the rule is fight for you way, while in Australia is a different story. I was so nervous on the day of my driving test because some of my Indonesian friends have failed, even mr. husband has failed at first attempt so I was soo thrilled when I passed the test at first attempt, oh yeah!

One thing for sure is I will be really nervous driving 110k/hour in a highway on the left side of the road back in Australia after driving 20k/hour on the right side of the road in Pohnpei.

We join hiking club in Pohnpei so every Sunday afternoon we gather at the appointed place to meet up with others before we head off to the hike destination.

Today is our second hike, we gather at the movie theater parking lot (oh yes in case you are wondering Pohnpei has cinema and the movies are quite up to date Wall Street is playing there now) at 1pm and wait for the others before we head off to our hike destination. This is an easy hike to Liduduhniap Twin Waterfalls in Nett, those waterfalls are on Nanpil river. The administrator of the hikers club will inform on the email about the difficulty level on each hike and as this one is easy so we are eager to go and also our hiking shoes just arrived on Friday. In this hike you can swim in the pool at base of one of the waterfalls.  We carpool part of the way up the road and walk the rest.   

This time no guide is needed, but there is an entrance fee of one dollars/person charged by the family that stays near the waterfall. 

Well to be honest this time is not actually hike as we parked way too close with the waterfalls, so we just walk for 5 minutes and we have arrived at the first waterfall yeah it was a hard work :p. Some of us are really eager to get sweaty so we decided to walk further down to the second waterfalls, it was a bit slippery and steep and the result I fell on my bum, hard. Guarantee of sore bum tomorrow :(

It was a good day to swim on the base of the waterfalls.


There is a memorial site at the entrace of the waterfalls to remember the tragic death of three members of Palau's athletic team on August 4, 2002. The victims were among the 20 some Palauan athletes and trainers on an afternoon excursion to the Twin Falls or the Liduduhniap Waterfalls in Nett Municipality, to continue their celebration of victory as the winners of the most medals in the recently completed 5th Micronesian Games.
At around 3 pm in the afternoon, the euphoria was interrupted by a sudden downpour of heavy rain followed almost simultaneously by a flashflood, feared and known by the locals as "Luwair," meaning the sneaky one."
The violent rush of water hit the group at the top of the first fall and dropped six people into the swirling pool of second fall. The group at the bottom had time to scramble to safety and with the assistance of the fast reacting residents, who had earlier forewarned the athletes of a flashflood, managed to rescue three out of the pool while the other three were swept away.
