Last night I got invited out to an workshop hosted by Downtown Dharma. It was, “Creating Love and Money: An evening to help you know your worth, create abundance, and attract real love.”

Now, anyone who knows me well, knows that I’m not really the workshop type. Not because I think my life is so fabulous that I don’t need help. I’m just not into the workshop vibe, usually (too touchy-feely, self-helpy). If there’s something about my life I want to fix, I’d rather read a book, see a professional, work hard at fixing.  Not so much with the talking about it.

BUT, I accepted this invite because one of the presenters was Andrea Syrtash. Andrea is a friend and sometimes client, and I genuinely like and respect her (hence the friend thing). So I was excited to go.

Anyway, I took lots of notes, but most of them are FOR ME.  Here’s something interesting I wrote down that I wanted to share with everyone.  And I hope I’m not misquoting Andrea:

“During the first 3 months of dating, everyone is lying.”

She went on to explain that people aren’t intentionally lying. Rather, they’re trying to please the person they’ve just met and like, mirroring the other person, on their best behavior…  Not, in other words, being their true selves.  And that it takes a few months for everyone, in a normal dating situation, to adjust and stop lying and start being normal/who they really are.  There are, of course, some people who are just lying phonies.

So, um…I started this post with a vague idea that it was going to be a poll.  But, truth is, I overslept and I’m running late and I’m not all that sure what exactly my question would be.  Other than, what do you think of this?  Which really isn’t a poll question.

So, what do you think of this?


I was on the phone last night, telling a friend about a date I have coming up (later today, wish me luck). It’s a guy I met online, and as I wrote about yesterday, his profile isn’t fabulous. It’s not horrible (good spelling and grammar). Just not fabulous.

So, I was telling my friend about it.  And he (my friend) asked me what was wrong with the profile and why I sounded so tentative about the date.  I stumbled a bit, because it was hard for me to put into words.

The thing is, this guy, his profile goes to great lengths to demonstrate just how happy and successful he is. In a way that crosses the line from proud-of-myself-and-my-accomplishments to arrogant-asshole. Demolishes the line. In my opinion.


But I don’t think he (my date) knows that. I get the sense that he’s actually a decent guy. A decent guy who doesn’t mean to brag.

Like, maybe he’s trying to present himself in the best possible way. Talk himself up. Perhaps overcompensate a bit for the things that he’s concerned about (like his age, which is more than 10+ years older than me and I’m guessing most of the women he approaches).

Now, honestly, back when my online dating message box was getting flooded with a dozen + new messages a day, I probably wouldn’t have given this guy a chance. Arrogance/bragging is a major turn-off for me. But right now, this guy is the pick of the litter. And it’s really important to me to get back out there and start dating again.

Wow, that sounds bad.  Like I’m totally settling for the best of my bad options. That really isn’t it. I’m just in a place where I’m thinking more about the person who’s writing the profile, rather than the profile itself. And I’m thinking that if a friend described this guy to me, I’d probably be curious and want to meet him.

Anyway, I’ll know soon enough if my instincts were right.  If he’s a decent guy or an arrogant douchebag.  I really hope it’s the former, as I’ve had my fill of the latter.

So, I’m a week or so into my most recent foray into online dating and I’ve been thinking about my theory of good daters vs daters. In short, some guys are great daters: fun, charming, sexy – but they suck at relationships. Others may be lousy on a first date, but deserve a second look because they’re good at relationships. And yeah, this is an oversimplification and there is overlap between the groups.

I wonder if the same kind of logic can be used for guys and online dating?

’m 40 now, so I’m not getting the same volume of messages that I used to (because I absolutely, positively won’t lie about my age, no matter what AND women over 38ish are less desirable in onlinedatingland). But I’ve gotten a few messages. And a few of those have sparked my interest.

However, all of their profiles kinda sucked. Even their messages kinda sucked, if I was going to be critical about it. Which, I guess, I would’ve been a couple of years ago.

My interest was sparked because I was reading between the lines and trying to figure out the answer to this question, if a friend was describing this guy to me, would I want to meet him?

Truth is, there are guys I see out there in onlinedatingland with awesome pics and great profiles. In some cases, the same damn ones they’ve been using since 2005. And we all know that it’s easy for people to hire someone to write their profiles AND all of their messages. So what? When it comes down to it, do I really care if someone has great writing skills. I’m not looking to hire a copywriter. Note: The top worst 3 dates I’ve ever had in terms of my dates being rude douchebags were with guys who had fabulously, amazing profiles. All 3 were writers.

I’m looking for guys I might want to meet/date, not the guys with the best profiles.

Hence my new question, if a friend was describing this guy to me, would I want to meet him?

Which is, I think, a good place to start.

Stay tuned.  One date scheduled for this week, so far.  I’m hopeful.  Crappy profile, but he seems like he might be a really decent guy.

I’ve written a lot about being single, and a lot about loneliness, but one thing I’ve never written about noise.

I hate noise.

I grew up with a lot of noise.  I come from a very noisy family.  Lots of screaming and yelling and fighting.  Not just when people were genuinely mad/upset.  All of the time.  Screaming, in my family, was the norm.  It was how people communicated.

And, in case you’re not familiar with those kinds of situations, it becomes an arms race, of sorts. Voices get higher and higher. So do the volumes on everything else.  The TVs, of which there were MANY (by the time I was a teenager we had more TVs than people in the house, but that’s SO another story) were all set to blaring. And then people screamed even louder to be heard over the TVs.

For those of you who are new here, I have a complicated relationship with my family (some members more than others). Things are much less complicated now than when I was younger, as I decided sometime in my 20s that it was important to me to make my relationships with them work.  No matter what.

Anyway, all that noise when I was a growing up affected me pretty deeply. In big ways and small ways.

The biggest way is that I avoid conflict in my relationships. Sometimes, in my attempts to avoid conflict, I accidently attract more conflict (by dodging small uncomfortable conversations for fear they might turn into fights, then having those turn into BIG fights later on).  But, if there was a way for me to remove all conflict from my life, I would.  I’ve been yelled at, and done enough yelling, for this lifetime. Yes, I know (in theory) there are people who can disagree without yelling, but I haven’t seen much evidence of that.

The fact is, I LOVE silence.  I love sitting in my quiet apartment.  All by myself.  I love working in quiet rooms. Reading in quiet rooms. Taking long walks, alone. The quiet of solitude makes me happy, in a way that few things can/do.

And then there are the small things. Like I’ve been in my new apartment for almost a month and still haven’t plugged in the TV. And I really can’t stand being at insanely loud parties/bars.  Or around people who need noise in their life (loud TV on in the background, all of the time, or loud music in the car).

Sometimes, I wonder about all of this. And I think that maybe my love of quiet is part of why I enjoy my single life so much. Why it’s such a good fit for me.  And why, conversely, the thought of spending time with someone who isn’t a great fit fills me with dread, instead of happiness (to have someone to spend time with). I also wonder about other people. Are other people as sensitive to noise as I am? Does it elicit the same emotional response in “normal people”?

My sense is that some people dread silence and will do just about anything to fill it.

And, more importantly, should I maybe avoid dating men who are comfortable with noise/who enjoy chaos and confrontation?

I have no answers. Just questions.
