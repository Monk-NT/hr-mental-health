#summary How to use Perl scripts

= Introduction =

This is a simple guide how to use provided perl script


= Counters and frequency script =

This script provides the basic word counter and frequency calculation. Frequencies calculated using this script are:
  * punctuation symbols frequency
  * function words frequency (_to be added_)
  * function words group frequency (_to be added_)
  * word length frequency


=== Punctuation symbols frequency ===
The punctuation symbols frequency is calculated by the fallowing formula:
{{{
FREQ_OF_SYMBOL=NO_OF_SYMBOL_IN_TEXT/NO_OF_ALL_SYMBOLS_IN_TEXT
}}}
The following symbols are counted:
  * .
  * ,
  * !
  * ?
  * "
  * -
  * :
  * ;

=== Word length frequency ===
Word length is calculated for lengths from 1 to 10+ where 10+ stands for words with length of 10 characters and above. The frequency is calcuated using fallowing formula:
{{{
FREQ_OF_LENGTH=NO_OF_WORDS_WITH_LENGTH/TOTAL_NO_OF_WORDS
}}}
=== Run example ===
If you want to use the script on `test.txt` for example (on windows machine):
{{{
perl wordCount.pl < test.txt > g.log
}}}
