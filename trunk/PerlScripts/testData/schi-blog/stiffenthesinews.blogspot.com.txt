
I've come to the point where 1) I've accepted suffering and 2) I'm willing to work harder for my health and sanity.

My path of discipline has been slowly progressing, and the more disciplined I am the more stable I am. This means I am willing to work harder at exercising 3-5 days a week instead of just whenever I feel like it, eating completely healthily, quit smoking, start projects I've been thinking about for awhile, stay focused on college courses, and controlling what I think about.

Now, controlling your thoughts is not about monitoring every thought that comes into your mind- you can't do that. But it is about immediately shifting your thoughts to something else when something comes up that bothers you or makes you sad, etc. I have been shifting thoughts slightly after a bad thought comes, but not immediately. Now I am ready to immediately do this. I have built up the strength.

I will be successful. Life isn't easy, but it's not impossible. It was only when I realized that I have to take a different path then others that I realized I would be successful. I was in denial about my illness and kept trying to do things the "right-normal" way. But I am completely satisfied now with my life's circumstances. I accept my illness, and I have come to the point where I don't just have faith that I will beat paranoid schizophrenia, I KNOW that I will.
