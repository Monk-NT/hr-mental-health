I was going to leave it for another day - I've been busy resting. But the big grey tomcat has been sick so I'm up now and I might as well say a piece.

Firstly, I must apologise for my last, angry outburst. There's no need to vent my disquiet in public. Except that I have been feeling rotten and I suppose it just boils over into this avenue of communication.

I've had some more comments made which is really nice. I'm obviously entertaining or informing one or two of you. Part of the attraction of going on the internet is to converse with people in similar or related situations. For all my seeming confidence, really, I'm a pretty isolated soul and have been for a number of years. It's not that I don't have the opportunity to socialise; it's just that my social skills are very rusty and I tend to lack motivation. Things are improving as time goes by. In fits and starts. But typing away here in the middle of the night is one way of moving things on a bit.

Anyway, I was going to say that, secondly, this is not a religious website so I won't do any evangelising - not that I'd necessarily be much good at it anyway - but I just wanted to let you know that I have had inner support from my understanding of the spiritual journey I'm on. It's not something that gets talked about much, certainly not in the psychiatric circles I'm party to. However, the sense of self harmony and peace which can accompany meditations on the great religious themes is worth a lot in the recovery-from-illness process. But, like I say, each to his own.

So how's the world shaping up? I'm a bit locked into my little corner at the moment. Somebody was saying on the T.V. the other night about how there's a feeling of doom and dread around in the air. Well, I'd rather not go too much into that: communal paranoia is a bit much. Leave it to the politicians and the churchmen. My plate is pretty full already.

My brothers seem to think I'm doing well. They've certainly seen me in much worse states before now. Personally, I feel a bit wobbly and unsure as to how things are going to go this year. It was all sewn up; or so I thought. Incredible how things can change, literally overnight. I remember when I'd been in the rehab. unit for a good while and something came up that made me show a bit of independent spirit. I was shifted back to the acute ward. And the consultant went off on annual leave. Man, I was really annoyed with him. I even enquired at the police station about whether it would be possible to trace him in order to get the move reversed. Things got sorted out in the end.

I didn't do badly overall as far as falling foul of the powers that be was concerned. The fact that my parents, my Dad in particular, had made a point of keeping in touch with the staff must've helped my case along. Three cheers for concerned family members. Really, the whole process is a complex web of interwoven causes-and-effects and I suppose the only thing I can say to folk who are just getting involved with the whole thing is to try and involve as many people as possible. Where I was admitted, they had an advocacy service, which I leaned heavily on. It didn't secure my immediate release as I was wishing, but I (at the very least) got to talk fairly and squarely with someone, independent of the hospital staff. That was a help.

O.K. The cat seems to be doing all right. I'll let you get back to what you were doing. See you soon. 'Bye, Alan.



Well, it's been quite a week in this young psychiatric patient's life. Lots of personal relationship stuff. The journey back into ?community? life is fraught with all sorts of snares and pitfalls. One of the most obvious is in how I get on with people in a friendly, personal way. That includes everybody: family, off-duty staff, old pals, the girl in the supermarket.... Some would say that I'm a bit sex mad. I certainly have travelled an immense distance in my understanding of myself in relation to others on that score. I used to be very hung up. But really, interpersonal relationships are so key to the whole recovery process that I have to make at least a passing mention.

OK, I'll shut up about that. How's things with you. Has spring finally sprung in your life? It's so important to learn to ride these waves that come past: to surf the moment. It takes patience and practice to get it right; but it's worthwhile when it happens. And, it's good therapy ? lose some of that psychological flabbiness that builds up being out of the mainstream of society. I ain't the Arnie Schwarzeneger of North East Fife Association for Mental Health, but I'm getting better as I gradually mix in with folk and rub shoulders with the ?normal? world. That sounds terrible. All I mean is that it's nice to be getting on with things.

I'm doing O.K. I think that now that things have settled a bit, I need to simply put the time in as regards making a life for myself. Start from where I am - that means going to the day hospital tomorrow. I'm back on track. The patient transport picks me up about 9am. Actually, tomorrow's a bit special because it's the day when we celebrate ten years of the Focus education service. That was set up between the local in-patient hospital and the further education college for the purposes of supported study and recreation. I go to the keep-fit session in the gym on Wednesday mornings and other folk do art, computing, health and beauty, numeracy and motor mechanics. It's tailored to suit people who are perhaps lacking in confidence or feeling left out of the mainstream syllabus. It's really just the sort of thing that needs to be done to keep improving the service provided by the hospital and in fact it's open to all who need a little help and encouragement to get on. It's true that when you've been ill, you don't tend to much feel like getting involved in social activities. It seems too much to deal with. So a friendly introduction is very appropriate. It's being held at the college around lunchtime - free buffet of course. And there aught to be a good crowd.

Still a long way to go for me. But I do see the light a-shining at the end of the tunnel. 

Hello again. I'm back from holiday. Nice time. It's very refreshing to get away and have a break in some friendly company. It's kind of a normal thing to do. That's one of the reasons that having one's freedom curtailed goes against the grain. Either in prison or in hospital. But with the medics, there really is a sense that it's for your own protection. Or at least, you get to realise that after a while. It's the old idea of sanctuary. I must admit that most folk are pretty horrified the first time around. In some ways, the shock of being admitted is part of the treatment. It kind of puts a stop to all the nonsense that's been going on before. Suddenly, everything becomes regular and generally inoffensive. It's a tough way of dealing with people in distress but I think it's not as unfair as it's often made out to be. After all, most people have had the experience of being made to go to school and it's kind of similar except you stay in after the doors are shut(!) Anyway, I'm feeling pretty good today. The sun has been shining brightly; summer is on it's way; and (if only) all's right with the world.

Schizo-affective disorder - it doesn't sound so bad once you get used to it. I still have mixed feelings about who I ought to talk to about it. This country's newspapers still run scare-mongering stories about axe-maniacs and horror situations. Of course for 99.9% of the time, as we all know, things go on quietly day by day. There's a lot of good which gets done imperceptibly over a long period of time. The backbone of the whole health service is probably patience. And innate trust that everyone is working for improvement, even though sometimes it seems like we have to go back a few steps to move on. Whatever, I hope things are good with you. See you soon


A few words before I scoot off and die. (Only kidding - I do feel pretty rough though)

There's no telling what's round the next corner. Might be nice; might be not. As long as I can return to the refuge of a clear and peaceful mind then I know that I'm doing not too bad. I've been in some hairy situations: a cool head is best. So, lend me that ice-pack - I need to lie down.

Keep well y'all. I'll be back. Alan.
