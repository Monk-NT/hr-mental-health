Mental wellness can not be fully defined. If it was to be defined, then I believe it would be defined by the ability to function equally in ones own culture and habitat, the ability to reach our own expectations in life and successfully deal with the trials and difficulties that lay on our path. Maybe mental wellness can be defined by a warm smile, a happy laugh, no matter our situation. The ability to enjoy life and to keep ourselves physically and mentally balanced and strong.

As someone that has lived with the destruction of Paranoid Schizophrenia, I can recognise strongly what mental wellness means to me, simply, because I know 1st hand how mental un-wellness has played a part in the destruction of my life. Mental wellness means different things to each individual and I believe to become aware of mental wellness you have to be very aware of mental un-wellness.

My own illness was triggered by my involvement with marching on the streets of Moscow in 1991, against the communist hardliners who attempted a coup against the then Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev. On my return to London I feared persecution from the KGB for my involvement with the marching. The stress and anxiety I was experiencing quickly formed into the destructive symptoms of schizophrenia.

My mental un-wellness was very apparent. My symptoms included voices, psychosis, false and irrational beliefs, thought disorder, suicidal thoughts, depression, lack of motivation, the feeling of being controlled by outside forces and paranoia and fear of persecution. These strong symptoms stayed with me for many years and I was unable to function in life, socialise, or complete the smallest of tasks. Even having a shower or shaving was sometimes too much and reduced me to tears.

Now, in 2007, my mental wellness can be strongly recognised. My own journey with schizophrenia, has taken me from the streets of Moscow, to the depths of demoralisation, to the heights of the Himalayas. Mental wellness has been established through my own self belief and will to survive and a strong recognition of how to work with and cope with the difficulties of schizophrenia.

My own wellness can be recognised and measured by good self esteem, the resilience to overcome and to control and recover from my symptoms. The ability to socialise, travel, communicate more eloquently and to maintain the ability of a good strong healthy body and mind. To survive and work on an equal basis within the expectations of myself and the world which now surrounds me. The ability to adapt and cope with whatever obstacles may lay in my path. The ability to be me!

Mental wellness has also been established by eventually finding a medication which worked with me, Seroquel, and the final recognition by others and myself, that I am greater than my diagnosis of schizophrenia. The holistic recognition of me, the whole person and my true capabilities, beyond that of a man who could do nothing more than try and cope with the destruction of his illness.



My own illness was 'fully' triggered on vacation in the USSR in 1991. Whilst in Moscow I marched on the streets against the communist hardliners who attempted a coup against the then Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev. On my return to London I began to fear persecution from the KGB for my involvement with the marching.

I tried to convince myself that I was under no threat and that my fears were unjustified but I quickly began to fear everyone and feared that my life was in danger. Stress and paranoia began to take its toll. I quickly became confused with my thinking, obsessed that I was being followed.

As the weeks passed, I had to leave my work. Anxiety and paranoia were ‘quickly and devastatingly’ beginning to ruin my life and a deep routed illness was setting in.

I was finally diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1996. Since my diagnosis I have been on a personal quest such as trekking and now even climbing in the Himalayas to help try and change peoples understanding of my illness, and to prove to others and ‘myself’ that we are greater than the labels and symptoms of our diagnosis.

When I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, I was told I was one of the severest cases that my psychiatrist had ever come across. I was also told I may never work again and that the rest of my life would be about coping with my illness.

My diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia is a correct diagnosis. I’ve always been able to recognize the symptoms such as the voices, psychosis, false and irrational beliefs, thought disorder, suicidal thoughts, depression, lack of motivation, the feeling of being controlled by outside forces and of course the paranoia and fear of persecution.

These symptoms have been very destructive and has taken away my life, my mind, love and family, and has offered very little in return…but I have learnt, my illness can also be very intriguing.

I personally believe that part of the reason my illness is so destructive is because ‘as yet’ we do not have full understanding of schizophrenia, its power and its possible use for creation. 
I believe that there’s something about the illness that is very creative, very insightful, very sensitive, very intuitive, even paranormal, that as yet, we have not truly understood or in fact discovered.

And if nurtured and understood correctly we could find something quite powerful within that could be used for creation over the devastation that we understand…

The purpose of my Everest challenge is to help prove there is life after diagnosis and living with such severe symptoms. I also wish to give a greater insight into my illness from the patient’s perspective and educate many about the intriguing and powerful and misunderstood illness of schizophrenia.

Will keep you posted. Stuart Baker-Brown.

inding the right medication not only helped my life but saved my life.

My road to recovery has been a long road, in which, I have learnt many things. I have changed my perception of schizophrenia over the years and do truly believe that this illness if nurtured successfully and understood successfully, can be extremely creative and powerful.

I have experienced all the destruction of schizophrenia and have lived with the symptoms day after day, month after month, year after year.

My illness has taken away my life and replaced my world with fear, misunderstanding, which has caused loved ones, family and society to keep their distance from me.

The illness has taken away my self worth, my value in society, and has left me on unequal terms in life, where many people view me as troublesome, someone who should be avoided, rather than seeing the real me, the caring, capable good man I strive to be…

Nowadays, I live with very little symptoms. This may be because of the natural progression of my illness…its had its day…It could also be down to the importance of, after so many years, finding a medication that truly worked with me. Seroquel.

Since I have been on Seroquel, I am starting to find myself in a very positive position in life. I recognise strongly that without finding the right medication, I wouldn’t be in this fortunate position.

I wouldn’t be able to think about one day climbing Everest.

Seroquel has helped to control my symptoms much better than any other medication. Having control of my symptoms has opened up a new life to me.

Having my symptoms controlled helps me to become a photographer, helps me to travel to the Himalayas, helps me to be on more equal terms in life again. And re-opens doors that were tightly closed.

I used to think that medication for mental illness, took away emotion, oppressed thoughts and feelings, and was a mental straight jacket…but I now recognise that the right medication can give back life where life was lost.

I live with very little side effects. Almost none. Other medication took away motivation, caused me to have severe side effects, huge weight gain, memory loss, shakes, amongst other things.

These side effects made me feel emotionally unwell, reminded me I had a severe mental illness and I felt that I had to deal with a separate illness to my schizophrenia.

I believe strongly in greater choice with medication and that psychiatry should work far more closely with the patient in understanding the patients true needs.

It took me a long while to get a change of medication and find the correct medication which truly worked with me.

Finding the correct medication has changed my life, helped me to function and has put me back on more equal terms not only with life but myself.

I can not stress the importance, as a patient, of finding correct medication. Its of the 'utmost' necessity in helping the sufferer regain control of their life and can only offer much needed mental well-being and balance.

I have received a request from ‘Irked’ magazine asking if I could write some words on the effects of love, work and identity, whilst coping with schizophrenia. The issues I have to say are huge and have great effect on my life and instead of the 1000 words I have allowed myself I could write 6000 or even more, such is the complexity and importance of the subjects in my own and others lives.

So, I will get straight to the point and say that having the diagnosis of schizophrenia and living with my symptoms has taken away many opportunities with all three topics. My illness has made ‘love’ very difficult and has taken away opportunity for work. As for identity, my schizophrenia has left me unsure of whom I really am and has taken much of my ‘true identity’ away and replaced it with an identity that has often has been ‘assumed’ by others. This is because of the labels and misconceptions that are attached to my illness.

I feel that since my diagnosis my ‘identity’ has been made for me and I am Stuart Baker-Brown schizophrenic and labelled, as many are with schizophrenia, as troublesome, a potentially threat, delusional, odd and generally as someone who should be avoided. As though that’s all I am capable of being!

In reality the above is far from the truth and is a ‘mistaken identity’ projected on me by many who know nothing about my diagnosis. I am the 1st to admit, yes, I can be unintentionally troublesome but I have reasons. Many strange things have happened to me, which have scared me, caused confusion and caused me to seem strange to others. But my real identity is a ‘man’ who is greater than his condition, a man who cares and loves and a man who strives to be ‘good and strong’ and creative in life. A man who wants to help others and who is ‘most definitely’ not a threat to society. Nor am I a man who is just delusional and hears voices.

In fact, I am like any good man worth his weight, a man who is far less a threat to society than most!

As for work, well, for many years I have been unable to work because of the strong symptoms of my condition, which have been very disabling.

Also, with great thanks to the people who should have been looking after my well being, I was signed off from work in 1996 and put on benefits for life and told that I may never be able to work again! That attitude from my nurse and psychiatrist helped to destroy me and remove any dignity and self-worth I had left after the destruction of my illness.

There is also the stigma and discrimination to overcome in the workplace. I once heard from someone of authority in mental health that a convict who had served time in prison for an ‘intentional crime’ had more potential finding work than someone with schizophrenia.

My head shakes with disbelief in that statement but unfortunately my heart knows there is truth to it. I believe we all deserve chances to prove ourselves, including convicts, but I use that point to highlight the difficulties for someone in my position to find work and to highlight the huge stigma which we have to face from people towards my diagnosis.

There are many people in my position who could and would given the right chance contribute immensely to the workplace but because of stigma and discrimination we are too often unfairly overlooked and not recognized for our potential.

And what of love? Possibly the greatest and most powerful emotion to mankind. An emotion and feeling we all desire. I have to say, love and schizophrenia have been a very awkward combination. Symptoms of schizophrenia include ‘paranoia and fear of persecution’, so although finding love is possible, keeping that love safe, has, in the past, been hard. Too often ‘trust’ can be a big issue in a relationship and too often ‘trust’ and symptoms of my illness are unable to work together in harmony.

In the past and when my symptoms were very active I sometimes accused my wife of spying on me and working for the KGB or MI5 and this often caused us much distress and unhappiness and so caused a drift between us and love was difficult to maintain.

My illness and the labels attached to it can also make it extremely hard for people like me to initiate a relationship or for others to make the 1st steps towards us. Too often the self-doubt and low self-esteem and lack of dignity that comes with schizophrenia can stop the process of finding a relationship, and so, stops possibilities of love.

And what of family love? Well, it is very common for families to break up where mental illness is concerned. I myself have been unable to have contact with my brothers and mother for some years because of my condition and their lack of acceptance and understanding towards me

So, love, is probably the most important topic to me out of the three. It’s most certainly the topic I yearn for the most.

I will end by saying, that love, work and identity, can be so difficult for us all. Add a diagnosis of schizophrenia to the equation and things can become much harder in life. But saying that, I believe with the right frame of mind and attitude, so much can be achieved.

I know in my life, I am finally finding my own true ‘identity’ beyond my label and with ‘work’ I am starting to find the ability and belief in myself to work again.

And as for love, I am no longer married but I am in search for love from someone who will fully accept me and my true capabilities, as I will accept them. Who knows where any relationship will go and what obstacles will get in my way, mental illness or not? We all just have to keep on believing in ourselves and keep striving forwards with hope.

That’s what keeps saving me.
