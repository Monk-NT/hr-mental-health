Altough the causes of homosexuality are the subject of much controversy, bipolar disorder is not one of the leading contenders. Theories of genetics and early environmental factors suggest that your sexuality has already started to cement, long before adulthood so it seems unlikely that something that usually kicks in at about 21, could change something already been largely decided for you.

However, many people believe that sexuality is a on a spectrum, rather than categorical, with most people falling towards the heterosexual end of the scale but not necessarily right at the extremities. Factors such as inhibition and social pressures may prevent someone who was mainly attracted to their opposite sex, from exploring the small part of them that desires same sex encounters. Mania is known to decrease inhibition and raise sexual arousal, therefore being manic could lead increased homosexual activity, if you were somewhere mid-scale. It is also possible that you could be entirely straight and have a homosexual encounter when manic, because mania distorts your thinking - likewise mania might lead a gay person to have a wild night of passion with a straight.

Nevertheless, homosexuality as a result of mania is likely to be a temporary condition which would stop once the mania stopped, with the exception being people with underlying bisexual or homosexual tendencies who needed something to kick-start their self-awareness.

Just as bipolar disorder leading to homosexuality is not a straight forward topic, neither is the debate as to whether or not homosexuality can cause mental health problems. Many theories about mental health problems suggest that an underlying genetic predisposition to an illness could lead to sickness if an individual experiences a stressful life event. Coming out to yourself and your loved ones is very stressful for some people.

So in conclusion, I don't think bipolar disorder can permanently change your sexuality, but mania could cause temporary homosexual activity, or open your eyes to tendancies you've had all along, but been too inhibited to explore.


I enjoyed Shutter Island, the new Martin Scorsese film based on the novel by Dennis Lehane. However it's another example of the irresponsible portrayal of people with bipolar disorder in the media.

A manic depressive woman, Dolores Chanal (played by Michelle Williams) drowns her three children in a lake. Because she is not the main character, her struggles with the illness are not well explored in the script, giving the impression that the bipolar disorder is an adequate explanation for multiple child killings.

Of course writers and directors want to make good, dramatic fiction, but it's particularly unhelpful when bipolar disorder is used time after time to explain away arson, murder and whatever other extreme plot devices an artist wishes to throw at us.

As a general rule, people suffering from bipolar disorder are not dangerous or even necessarily criminal in their behaviour. Would it really hurt directors to acknowledge this? The character Dr. Cawley (played by Dr. Cawley) had quite a lot to say about psychiatry. Perhaps they could have got him to point out that whilst bipolar disorder may have been a major cause for stress in Delores life, it is unlikely to have been the sole cause of her downing her own children.


Dear Melanie Vaughan,

"It was one of the most embarrassing things I have ever known. It ruined the wedding." you told the press.

You ruined your own wedding day, by being so quick to judge other people.

As you will recall, it, was a photographer named Kate Summers, who had started living as a woman during the months after taking your booking, then known as Dave Stonestreet. Just so you know - most of us prefer to use the pronoun she when referring to a woman.

The gender identity Kate chooses is a matter of personal choice and not really any of your business. However despite this fact, she was courteous enough to mention her change to you before the wedding, something which you claimed to be comfortable with at the time and later retracted, (perhaps when you realised outrage might have more media-potential.)

From your reaction, anyone would have thought Dame Edna Everage herself had walked into your wedding wearing a bikini, not a brunette middle-aged woman with tidy hair and a modest calf-length skirt.

Yet despite Kate's modest dress, you told the press, "I had no idea how bad it would be." Apparently you thought she would come in a trouser suit.

A woman living as a woman, turns up dressed like a woman! What an awful shock that must have been.

I notice that your other female guests are not in trouser suits, nor you, so why would you expect Kate to wear one?

In addition to unacceptable intolerance, you have shown utter hypocrisy by saying, "I'm open-minded" and "I do understand what he's going through." No you don't, or you wouldn't be moaning to the national press that Kate had ruined your wedding day when it appears that she was just to have been trying to earn an honest day's pay! And "I'm open-minded" doesn't even begin to demonstrate open-mindedness if it's followed by "but he looked ridiculous."

I very much doubt that it was Kate's intention to upstage you on your wedding day, she was probably just trying to get on with her life. It is you who has turned an occasion that was supposed to symbolise your love for Anthony, into an attack on the transgender community.

If your wedding could be ruined by a virtual stranger having a sex change, it must have been tottering near the brink of destruction anyway.

What would you have Kate do instead? Live as a man when she feels as a woman? Or would you just rather she just stayed at home and never went out to work?

You say you're not happy with the photos, but what do you expect if you and your guests held such contempt for the lady behind the camera?

By the way, are you the same Melanie Vaughan who went whining to the press when a security guard wouldn't carry your pushchair up some stairs? Granted, your fall-out with The Job Centre Plus is not riddled with bigotry and poison like this most recent complaint, but it does suggest that you might be inclined to view everyday frustrations in terms of their media potential.

However this time it's backfired. Rather than reflecting badly on Ms. Summers, your recent comments to the press have shown you to be an intolerant, spiteful and media-hungry person.

Transgender people pop up everywhere within the community - on buses, in supermarkets, at church and even at weddings, but you don't see other people running crying to "Love It" magazine.

I suggest that you make a public apology, both to Ms. Summers and the wider transgender community, if you want to emerge from this situation with even a shred of dignity intact.
