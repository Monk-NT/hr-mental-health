OK…enough is enough. I’m friggin’ sick and tired of doctors labeling me with terms like “bipolar”, “clinically depressed”, “attention deficient without hyperactive tendencies”, and more. Ya know why I’m fed up with it? It’s certainly not because I don’t have those. It’s because….I AM NOT THOSE! I’m ME! I’m me with some problems. But, I am more than just those problems. I’M ME!

What is causing this rant? Just got off the phone with my sister-in-law, who is fresh out of the mental ward..AGAIN. She was rambling on and on about why she was admitted and then she said….”What are you? I’m bipolar and have SAD (seasonal affective disorder)”.

I answered, “Well, I’m ME. That’s what I am”.

She didn’t get it. “No,” she said, “what do the doctors tell you that you are?”

I answered, “I don’t really give a fuck what the doctors say that I am because I am NOT their diagnosis. I am ME and I happen to have BP, AADD, and a probably a little OCD. But, those are just labels. I am so much more than those damn labels.

I don’t know about y’all but I’m sick and tired of hearing people who have not even been properly diagnosed  going around proudly announcing, “I’m BIPOLAR”. Not saying that some of them are not. Just sayin’ that I think the psych doctors (and some lots of regular ol’ MDs) are waaay to eager to attach a label to a patient, hand them some scripts for psych meds that will screw with their brains. All in about 15 minutes time. The ol’ Treat ‘Em and Street ‘Em and get the next one in. Some do this out of total ignorance but there are many who do it out of greed.

They don’t give a second thought to the long-term effects of many of the psych meds. No, at the end of the day, they climb into their cars and drive home to have a lovely dinner with the family. Meanwhile, many of their patients can’t even drive a friggin’ car because they are too screwed up from either the meds or the side effects. And, many don’t have families anymore. And, many couldn’t even sit upright in a chair to eat dinner even if they had a family.

SO JUST STOP! Don’t ask me “what are you”? I’m ME…not a damn label. I don’t play those games anymore.


The program “What’s Triggering Eating You” and the sponsors it uses, that’s one thing that’s eating me.

The poor judgement in general of all involved in putting such a  program on the air takes another bite.

The so-called professional participants (physicians, therapists and nutritionists) who should know better, who should have responded “NO, what are you thinking? Bad idea!” -but instead whored themselves out for a paycheck…that doesn’t just eat at me, it pisses me off.

It also does not surprise me.

Perhaps there’s a method to their madness, after all, triggering a relapse or recruiting new patients from amongst their viewers is a win for them.  ”Helping people” my ass.

They know the thought process of their patients by now. A program such as this is a magnet. Who needs “The Biggest Loser” when there are real tips, tricks and competition to be had? Tell us the weight of that girl going inpatient and it’s like, “Game on” (and yes, they did, they went there)

There’s so much wrong with a program like this being on television I don’t know where to begin…


…so I’ll start with its sponsors.

Seriously Jenny Freaking Craig? Who makes these decisions? What exactly is the thought process that goes into that?

“Hey, how about after ten minutes of watching yet another bulimic eat  and puke…we toss in a diet commercial?”

“Great idea….can we fit in a Vegas commercial as well? You know…the ones with all the women who look perfect, the less clothes the better..so while we’re at it, let’s throw in Victoria’s Secret”

Note to the morons at E ! *exclamation point …because they think they’re exciting or something* :

Cars, contacts, insurance, furniture polish. Good.

MGD64 “diet beer”  that mentions calories and burning them-Bad.

5 Hour Energy. Zero sugar, only four calories. Hell that’s practically a food group unto itself. Yet another great choice, you idiots.

Applebee’s. *shakes head*

Clinique’s “Even Better” something skin crap…well yes, YOU’RE NEVER GOOD ENOUGH, so buy up.

All you can eat pancakes at IHOP. Seriously, are they kidding? Perhaps they overlooked a toilet bowl cleaner sponsor, that’d be a great follow-up to a pancake binge commercial.

True Balance toning shoes. “Burn calories and activate muscles…” That’s a great idea, especially when you have no muscles to tone because they’ve waisted away from starvation.

Butterfingers Bingers Snackers. Shameless.

A “Married to Rock” promo. Married to rock and surgically altered bodies. Terrific.

Do the people who makes these decisions actually get paid for being so stupid?!
