In the recovery movement, which is the zeitgeist in the delivery of mental health services at this time, we are supposed to look past someone’s diagnosis. I am not “a bipolar” or “depressive” or “schizophrenic.” I have been diagnosed with such, but the relevance of that diagnosis is highly suspect. Because aren’t I just Liz? Liz who is addicted to Dunkin Donuts hazelnut coffee, Liz who likes chihuahuas in sweaters, Liz who tries to do gluteal exercises to increase her butt’s circumference — without success. So many things make up my Liz-ness, right? So who cares what some doctor said?

Generally speaking, I agree with this approach. For many years we have been labelling people in an attempt to treat them, and the results aren’t exactly stellar. So why not change protocols, DSM by damned?

Yet as a person who works on the frontlines of mental health care, I sometimes do find myself stymied by a person’s behavior, and a diagnosis can (infrequently) help. Because there certainly are definable characteristics of certain illnesses that can help me understand where a person is coming from. It also helps in distinguishing substance abuse from simple illness.

Here’s what I mean. Say I meet a guy who talks to me about his power over floating CGI-enhanced rabbit-shaped angels — who says he can get me anything I want by talking to them and persuading them. This is not true. By any measure we use to determine reality, the CGI-enhanced rabbit-shaped angel is clearly a fiction. But what if he slurs while he tells me this? What if he leaves that day and I have to understand what’s going on so I can advocate for him? Wouldn’t many people think, “That guy is on some serious crack.”

Now, we’d like to think a mental health professional would be more sophisticated than that, but then, you’d be assuming a level of knowledge that some MHPs simply don’t have (I say that with love). So if you look at this guy’s medical records and it says he has been diagnosed 10 times by 10 different doctors in the last 10 years as a person with schizophrenia, that might be good knowledge to have. Additionally, if his records state that he has never used drugs or alcohol, that’s also good to know.

I’m not saying that guy is only his diagnosis. I’m saying that hearing what psychiatrists have labeled him with for a decade might be useful information for me to have if I’m going to help him.

Similarly, the search for diagnosis can be a good road to travel. In today’s Washington Post, a mother asks Marguerite Kelly what her depressed daughter should do — meds or exercise? Kelly gives an answer that anyone should get in the absence of clinical assessment:

    
This is a good protocol in search of a diagnosis. That being said, my psychiatrist reminds me again and again he doesn’t care what my label is; he just wants to help me feel better. And it’s true that it doesn’t matter if you call it OCD or bipolar of DID or PPP (for Poo Poo Poo), if you’re counting every crack in the sidewalk, it’s probably time for some help.

These are my thoughts for today, messy though they are. I’d love to hear your thoughts.
