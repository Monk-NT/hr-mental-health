ot two minutes ago, a liberal tweeter said three words to me: “Michelle Bachmann #psycho”. This is pretty typical fare from certain members of the Twitter Left (and the Twitter Right for their part). When poorly educated, shallow Republican tools speak up, their words are denounced as coming from the mentally ill.

Let me get something clear. I am a progressive. I was a progressive before I went on meds and I am a progressive now. Part of my political ideology impels me to live a life as free of prejudice as possible. Supposedly the woman who vomited this hairball believes in the same principle. I doubt she would attack Michael Steele’s blackness or call Senator Graham a fag. But she doesn’t live it when it comes to the mentally ill. Where we are concerned, the rules change. You can abuse the mentally ill all you want through the indirect means of equating psychiatric diagnoses with the follies of your enemies.

Bray ends her article by observing that the three parties in Great Britain have signed a compact agreeing to avoid stigmatizing language in their political debates, campaigns, and other public utterances. When I hear even liberals whine when they are called to task for the abuse of psychiatric terminology, I think it essential that we begin to civilize our language so that people are not made to hate themselves for accidents of genetics.

Stop saying that Michelle Bachmann is insane. She’s not anything like me.
