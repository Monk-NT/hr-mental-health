1985 I first became fully aware that the struggle with the disorder in my mind--a struggle which had
engaged me for several months--might have a fatal outcome.
The moment of revelation came as the car in which I was riding moved down a rain-slick street not far
from the Champs-filysees and slid past a dully glowing neon sign that read HOTEL WASHINGTON. I
had not seen that hotel in nearly thirty-five years, since the spring of 1952, when for several nights it
had become my initial Parisian roosting place. In the first few months of my Wanderjahr, I had come
down to Paris by train from Copenhagen, and landed at the Hotel Washington through the whimsical
determination of a New York travel agent. In those days the hotel was one of the many damp, plain
hostelries made for tourists, chiefly American, of very modest means who, if they were like me--
colliding nervously for the first time with the
French and their droll kinks would always remember how the exotic bidet, positioned solidly in the
drab bedroom, along with the toilet far down the ill-lit hallway, virtually defined the chasm between
Gallic and Anglo-Saxon cultures. But I stayed at the Washington for only a short time. Within days I
had been urged out of the place by some newly found young American friends who got me installed
in an even seedier but more colorful hotel in Montparnasse, hard by Le Dome and other suitably
literary hangouts. (In my mid-twenties, I had just published a first novel and was a celebrity, though
one of very low rank since few of the Americans in Paris had heard of my book, let alone read it.) And
over the years the Hotel Washington gradually disappeared from my consciousness.
It reappeared, however, that October night when I passed the gray stone facade in a drizzle, and the
recollection of my arrival so many years before started flooding back, causing me to feel that I had
come fatally full circle. I recall saying to myself that when I left Paris for New York the next morning it
would be a matter of forever. I was shaken by the certainty with which I accepted the idea that I
would never see France again, just as I would never recapture a lucidity that was slipping away from
me with terrifying speed.
Only days before I had concluded that I was suffering from a serious depressive illness, and was
floundering helplessly in my efforts to deal with it. I wasn't cheered by the festive occasion that had
brought me to France. Of the many dreadful manifestations of the disease, both physical and
psychological, a sense of self-hatred or, put less categorically, a failure of selfesteem is one of the most
universally experienced symptoms, and I had suffered more and more from a general feeling of
worthlessness as the malady had progressed.
My dank joylessness was therefore all the more ironic because I had flown on a rushed four-day trip to
Paris in order to accept an award which should have sparklingly restored my ego. Earlier that summer
I received word that I had been chosen to receive the Prix Mondial Cino del Duca, given annually to
an artist or scientist whose work reflects themes or principles of a certain "humanism." The prize was
established in memory of Cino del Duca, an immigrant from Italy who amassed a fortune just before
and after World War II by printing and distributing cheap magazines, principally comic books, though
later branching out into publications of quality; he became proprietor of the newspaper Paris-Jour. He
also produced movies and was a prominent racehorse owner,
enjoying the pleasure of having many winners in France and abroad. Aiming for nobler cultural
satisfactions, he evolved into a renowned philanthropist and along the way established a bookpublishing
firm that began to produce works of literary merit (by chance, my first novel, Lie Down in
Darkness, was one of del Duca's offerings, in a translation entitled Un Lit de Tenebres}; by the time of
his death in 1967 this house, Editions Month ales, became an important entity of a multifold empire
that was rich yet prestigious enough for there to be scant memory of its comic-book origins when del
Duca's widow, Simone, created a foundation whose chief function was the annual bestowal of the
eponymous award.
The Prix Mondial Cino del Duca has become greatly respected in France--a nation pleasantly besotted
with cultural prize giving--not only for its eclecticism and the distinction shown in the choice of its
recipients but for the openhandedness of the prize itself, which that year amounted to approximately
$25,000. Among the winners during the past twenty years have been Kon rad Lorenz, Alejo
Carpentier, Jean Anouilh, Ignazio Silone, Andrei Sakharov, Jorge Luis Borges and one American,
Lewis Mumford. (No women as yet, feminists take note.) As an American, I found it especially hard
not to feel honored by inclusion in their company.
While the giving and receiving of prizes usually induce from all sources an unhealthy uprising of false
modesty, backbiting, self-torture and envy, my own view is that certain awards, though not necessary,
can be very nice to receive. The Prix del Duca was to me so straightforwardly nice that any extensive
self examination seemed silly, and so I accepted gratefully, writing in reply that I would honor the
reasonable requirement that I be present for the ceremony. At that time I looked forward to a leisurely
trip, not a hasty turnaround. Had I been able to foresee my state of mind as the date of the award
approached, I would not have accepted at all.
Depression is a disorder of mood, so mysteriously painful and elusive in the way it becomes known to
the self--to the mediating intellect--as to verge close to being beyond description. It thus remains
nearly incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it in its extreme mode, although the
gloom, "the blues" which people go through occasionally and associate with the general hassle of
everyday existence are of such prevalence that they do give many individuals a hint of the illness in its
catastrophic form. But at the time of which I write I had descended far past those familiar, manageable
doldrums. In Paris, I am able to
see now, I was at a critical stage in the development of the disease, situated at an ominous way station
between its unfocused stirrings earlier that summer and the near-violent denouement of December,
which sent me into the hospital. I will later attempt to describe the evolution of this malady, from its
earliest origins to my eventual hospitalization and recovery, but the Paris trip has retained a notable
meaning for me.
On the day of the award ceremony, which was to take place at noon and be followed by a formal
luncheon, I woke up at midmorning in my room at the Hotel Pont-Royal commenting to myself that I
felt reasonably sound, and I passed the good word along to my wife, Rose. Aided by the minor
tranquilizer Halcion, I had managed to defeat my insomnia and get a few hours' sleep. Thus I was in
fair spirits. But such wan cheer was an habitual pretense which I knew meant very little, for I was
certain to feel ghastly before nightfall. I had come to a point where I was carefully monitoring each
phase of my deteriorating condition. My acceptance of the illness followed several months of denial
during which, at first, I had ascribed the malaise and restlessness and sudden fits of anxiety to
withdrawal from alcohol; I had abruptly abandoned whiskey and all other intoxicants that June.
During the course of my worsening emotional climate I had read a certain amount on the subject of
depression, both in books tailored for the layman and in weightier professional works including the
psychiatrists' bible, DSM (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric
Association}. Throughout much of my life I have been compelled, perhaps unwisely, to become an
autodidact in medicine, and have accumulated a better-than-average amateur's knowledge about
medical matters (to which many of my friends, surely unwisely, have often deferred), and so it came
as an astonishment to me that I was close to a total ignoramus about depression, which can be as
serious a medical affair as diabetes or cancer. Most likely, as an incipient depressive, I had always
subconsciously rejected or ignored the proper knowledge; it cut too close to the psychic bone, and I
shoved it aside as an unwelcome addition to my store of information.
At any rate, during the few hours when the depressive state itself eased off long enough to permit the
luxury of concentration, I had recently filled this vacuum with fairly extensive reading and I had
absorbed many fascinating and troubling facts, which, however, I could not put to practical use. The
most honest authorities face up squarely to the fact that serious depression is not readily treatable.
Unlike, let us say, diabetes, where immediate measures taken to rearrange the body's adaptation to
glucose can dramatically reverse a dangerous process and bring it under control, depression in its
major stages possesses no quickly available remedy: failure of alleviation is one of the most distressing
factors of the disorder as it reveals itself to the victim, and one that helps situate it squarely in the
category of grave diseases. Except in those maladies strictly designated as malignant or degenerative,
we expect some kind of treatment and eventual amelioration, by pills or physical therapy or diet or
surgery, with a logical progression from the initial relief of symptoms to final cure. Frighteningly, the
layman-sufferer from major depression, taking a peek into some of the many books currently on the
market, will find much in the way of theory and symptomatology and very little that legitimately
suggests the possibility of quick rescue. Those that do claim an easy way out are glib and most likely
fraudulent. There are decent popular works which intelligently point the way toward treatment and
cure, demonstrating how certain therapies--psychotherapy or pharmacology, or a combination of
these--can indeed restore people to health in all but the most persistent and devastating cases; but the
wisest books among them underscore the hard truth that serious depressions do not disappear
overnight. All of this emphasizes an essential though difficult reality which I think needs stating at the
outset of my own chronicle: the disease of depression remains a great mystery. It has yielded its
secrets to science far more reluctantly than many of the other major ills besetting us. The intense and
sometimes comically strident factionalism that exists in present day psychiatry--the schism between
the believers in psychotherapy and the adherents of pharmacology-resembles the medical quarrels of
the eighteenth century (to bleed or not to bleed) and almost defines in itself the inexplicable nature of
depression and the difficulty of its treatment. As a clinician in the field told me honestly and, I think,
with a striking deftness of analogy: "If you compare our knowledge with Colum bus's discovery of
America, America is yet unknown; we are still down on that little island in the Bahamas."
In my reading I had learned, for example, that in at least one interesting respect my own case was
atypical.
Most people who begin to suffer from the illness are laid low in the morning, with such malefic effect
that they are unable to get out of bed. They feel better only as the day wears on. But my situation was
just the reverse. While I was able to rise and function almost normally during the earlier part of the
day, I began to sense the onset of the symptoms at midafternoon or a little later--gloom crowding in
on me, a sense of dread and alienation and, above all, stifling anxiety. I suspect that it is basically a
matter of indifference whether one suffers the most in the morning or the evening: if these states of
excruciating near-paralysis are similar, as they probably are, the question of timing would seem to be
academic. But it was no doubt the turnabout of the usual daily onset of symptoms that allowed me
that morning in Paris to proceed without mishap, feeling more or less self-possessed, to the gloriously
ornate palace on the Right Bank that houses the Fondation Cino del Duca. There, in a rococo salon, I
was presented with the award before a small crowd of French cultural figures, and made my speech of
acceptance with what I felt was passable aplomb, stating that while I was donating the bulk of my
prize money to various organizations fostering French American goodwill, including the American
Hospital in Neuilly, there was a limit to altruism (this spoken jokingly) and so I hoped it would not be
taken amiss if I held back a small portion for myself.
What I did not say, and which was no joke, was that
the amount I was withholding was to pay for two tickets the next day on the Concorde, so that I might
return speedily with Rose to the United States, where just a few days before I had made an
appointment to see a psychiatrist.
