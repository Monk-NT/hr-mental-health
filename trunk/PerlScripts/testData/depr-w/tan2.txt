The first night Kai Jing and I tried forbidden joy, it was summertime, a bright-moon
night. We had slipped into a dark storage room at the abandoned end of a corridor,
far from the eyes and ears of others. I had no shame, no guilty feelings. I felt wild
and new, as though I could swim the heavens and fly through waves. And if this was
bad fate, let it be. I was the daughter of Precious Auntie, a woman who also could
not control her desires, who then gave birth to me. How could this be bad when the
skin on Kai Jing's back was so smooth, so warm, so fragrant? Was it also fate to feel
his lips on my neck? When he unbuttoned the back of my blouse and it fell to the
floor, I was ruined, and I was glad. Then the rest of my clothing slipped off, piece by
piece, and I felt I was growing lighter and darker. He and I were two shadows, black
and airy, folding and blending, weak yet fierce, weightless, mindless of others—until I
opened my eyes and saw that a dozen people were watching us.
Kai Jing laughed. "No, no, they're not real." He tapped one. They were the paintedover
theater of hell, now converted to Merry Christmas.
"They're like an audience at a bad opera," I said, "not so pleased." There was Mother
Mary with a screaming mouth, the sheepherders with pointed heads, and Baby
Jesus, whose eyes stuck out like a frog's. Kai Jing draped my blouse over the head
of Mary. He covered Joseph with my skirt, while Baby Jesus received my slip. Then
Kai Jing put his own clothes over the Three Wise Men and turned the sheepherders
around. When all their eyes faced the wall, Kai Jing guided me to lie down in the
straw, and once more we became shadows.
But what happened after that was not like a poem or a painting of the fourth level.
We were not like nature, as beautifully harmonious as a leafy tree against the sky.
We had expected all these things. But the straw made us itch and the floor stank of
urine. A rat stumbled out of its nest, and this caused Kai Jing to roll off me and knock
Baby Jesus out of his crib. The frog-eyed monster lay next to us, as if it were our
love child. Then Kai Jing stood up and lighted a match, searching for the rat. And
when I looked at Kai Jing's private parts, I saw he was no longer possessed. I also
saw he had ticks on his thigh. A moment later, he pointed out three on my bottom. I
jumped up and was dancing to shake them off. I had to try very hard not to laugh and
cry as Kai Jing turned me around and inspected me, then burned off the ticks with
the tip of a match. When I took back my blouse from Mary's head, she looked glad
that I was ashamed, even though we had not fulfilled our desires.
As we quickly dressed, Kai Jing and I were too embarrassed to talk. He also said
nothing as he walked me to my room. But at the door, he told me, "I'm sorry. I should
have controlled myself." My heart hurt. I didn't want to hear his apology, his regrets. I
heard him add: "I should have waited until we're married." And then I gasped and
began to cry, and he embraced me and uttered promises that we would be lovers for
ten thousand lifetimes, and I vowed the same, until we heard a loud "Shhhh!" Even
after we quieted, Sister Yu, whose room was next to mine, kept grumbling: "No
consideration for others. Worse than roosters . . ."
The next morning, I felt like a different person, happy but also worried. Sister Yu had
once said that you could tell which girls in the lanes were prostitutes because they
had eyes like chickens. What she meant by this, I didn't know. Did the eyes become
redder or smaller? Would others see in my eyes that I had a new kind of knowledge?
When I arrived in the main hall for breakfast, I saw that almost everyone was there,
gathered in a circle, talking in serious voices. As I walked in, it seemed that all the
teachers lifted their eyes to stare at me, shocked and sad. Then Kai Jing shook his
head. "Bad news," he said, and the blood drained from my limbs so that even if I had
wanted to run away I was too weak to do so. Would I be kicked out? Had Kai Jing's
father refused to let him marry me? But how did they know? Who told? Who saw?
Who heard? Kai Jing pointed to the shortwave radio that belonged to the scientists,
and the others turned back to listen. And I wondered: Now the radio is announcing
what we did? In English?
When Kai Jing finally told me, I didn't have even one moment to be relieved that the
bad news was not about me. "The Japanese attacked last night," he said, "close to
Peking, and everyone is saying it is war for sure."
Maku polo this, maku polo that, I heard the radio voice say. I asked: "What is this
maku thing?"
Sister Yu said, "The Maku Polo Bridge. The island dwarves have captured it." I was
surprised to hear her use this slur for the Japanese. In the school, she was the one
who taught the girls not to use bad names, even for those we hated. Sister Yu went
on: "Shot their rifles in the air—just for practice, they said. So our army shot back to
teach the liars a lesson. And now one of the dwarves is missing. Probably the
coward ran away, but the Japanese are saying one missing man is enough reason to
declare war." With Sister Yu translating the English into Chinese, it was hard to tell
which was the news and which were her opinions.
"This Maku Polo Bridge," I said, "how far away is it?"
"North of here, in Wanping," Miss Grutoff said, "close to the railway station."
"But that's the Reed Moat Bridge, forty-six kilometers from my village," I said. "When
did they start calling it something else?"
"More than six hundred years ago," Miss Grutoff said, "when Marco Polo first
admired it." And as everyone continued to talk about the war, I was wondering why
no one in our village knew the bridge had changed its name so long before. "Which
way are the Japanese advancing?" I asked. "North to Peking or south to here?"
Everyone stopped talking at once. A woman stood in the doorway. With the bright
sun behind her, she was a shadow, and I could not make out who she was, only that
she wore a dress. "Is Liu LuLing still living here?" I heard her say. I squinted. Who
was asking this? I was already confused about so many things, now this as well. As I
walked toward her, my confusion turned into a guess, then the guess into a certainty.
Precious Auntie. I had often dreamed that her ghost would come back. As in dreams,
she could talk and her face was whole, and as in dreams, I rushed toward her. And
at last, this time she did not push me away. She threw open her arms and cried: "So
you still recognize your own sister!"
It was GaoLing. We spun each other around, danced and slapped each other's arms,
taking turns to cry, "Look at you." I had not heard from her since she wrote me the
letter four or five years before. In minutes, we were treating each other like sisters
once again. "What's happened to your hair?" I joked, grabbing her messy curls.
"Was it an accident, or did you do this on purpose?"
"Do you like it?"
"Not bad. You look modern, no longer the country girl."
"No flies circling your head, either. I heard rumors you're now a high-and-mighty
intellectual."
"Only a teacher. And you, are you still—"
"Wife to Chang Fu Nan. Six years already, hard to believe."
"But what's happened to you? You look terrible."
"I haven't eaten since yesterday."
I jumped up, went to the kitchen, and brought her back a bowl of millet porridge,
some pickles and steamed peanuts, and little cold dishes. We sat in a corner of the
hall, away from news of the war, she eating with much noise and speed. "We've
been living in Peking, Fu Nan and I, no children," she said between thick mouthfuls.
"We have the back rooms of the ink shop. Everything's been rebuilt. Did I tell you this
in my letter?"
"Some."
"Then you know that the Changs own the business, our family owns only the debt.
Father and our uncles are back in Immortal Heart village, churning out ink till it
sweats from their pores. And now that they're home all the time, they have bad
tempers and argue constantly among themselves about who is to blame for this,
that, and the weather."
"What about First Brother and Second Brother?" I asked. "Home, too?"
"The Nationalists conscripted First Brother five years ago.
