Recently I went on holiday to Bhutan, a small, unspoiled Buddhist kingdom in the foothills of the Himalayas. It ’s lived in self-imposed isolation for decades and has only recently opened for business. It ’s all forests, mountains, single-lane roads, sheer three-thousand-foot drops to the valley below and people in funny— compulsory—national dress. (The men have to wear argyle-patterned knee socks and oversized dressing gowns, hitched up over a waist belt to create a charming blouson effect. Look it up on the Net if you don’t believe me.)
I thought Bhutan would be fascinating—which indeed it was— but it was only after I’d arrived that I discovered the main reason people go there is to “trek.”
Trekking. Even the word annoys me. And “rambling”—there ’s another one. It ’s walking, and giving it a fancy title changes nothing.
The thing is, me and exercise have never really seen eye-to-eye. (I do yoga. About once a year.) Nor have me and the “outdoors.” Walking the thirty yards from the car park to the shops, I sometimes get an earache. So when I go on holiday, my normally sedentary lifestyle goes down several gears, until I’m practically flatlining.
But after a week of nonstop Buddhist temples, I was ready for a change, and when our guide suggested “a nice, easy walk,” my husband
looked at me with desperate, pleading eyes and I was persuaded.
“But you’ll need flat shoes,” the guide said, looking at my boots.
“These are flat,” I replied. They had only two-and-a-half-inch heels, what was he talking about? He handed me a brushed steel and latex “walking pole” and the three of us set off. It was a lot more uphill than I’d been led to expect, but between the fir trees, the clean blue sky, the stunning views, the blood flowing in my veins, my heart pounding in my chest (but not too much), the way the air smelled exactly like Fanta—suddenly I got it. I felt great.
We stopped at a seventh-century Buddhist monastery, where we met a monk who looked unnervingly like the Irish comedian Graham
Norton in orange panstick and a red robe. Appropriately enough he “blessed” me with an eighteen-inch phallus, which could have come straight from Anne Summers, but apparently was some ancient artifact. It was only then that I discovered that people come from around the globe to this monastery to get pregnant. I didn’t get the deluxe fertility treatment, which involves several monks, chanting and burning things, but all the same, if I get up the duff, I’ll let you know.
Then we carried on through the deserted forest, passing a three-hundred-year-old stupa (holy sort-of-shrine yoke) and I nearly died of fright when I saw a small girl, nestled in one of its hollows, eating
what appeared to be a panpipe.
Finally we reached the top, and the sense of achievement was indescribable.
Exhilarated, I leaned on my pole, surveying the valley, feeling like Sir Edmund Hillary.
It was a moment of personal epiphany: I can be different. I can change. I will become a trekker. Or a rambler. Whichever is better. I will buy a pole. And proper flat walking boots. I would have a “hobby,” an “interest.” Up to that point if anyone had asked me what my “interests” were, I’d have replied, “Handbags, Kit Kats, George Clooney.”
A new, exciting future unrolled itself in front of me, for inspection.
I’d be strong, sinewy, as thin as a whippet. All my holidays would be spent heading off with a rucksack full of high-protein bars to climb the Andes and the like. I might even lose the tops of a couple of fingers to frostbite, and everyone would think I was fabulous.
People would ask me why I climbed the highest peaks in the world (I had mutated from being an ordinary trekker to a mountaineer)
and I would reply, “Why do dogs lick their balls? Because they can, Oprah, because they can.” And nobody would think I was vulgar.
From now on I would only wear track suits made out of those high-tech fabrics which can stop a speeding bullet but weigh less than a feather. I would never wear skirts, except on special occasions,
when, although I would be lovely and slim, my calves would be bunched and enormous in my high heels and my legs would be bandy. I would look like a transvestite, exactly like Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot. But I wouldn’t care. The broken veins in my cheeks wouldn’t matter, either. I would have a solid, cast-iron identity.
Then I got home from Bhutan and unpacked and looked at the mountain of shite arrayed on my bed—stuff I’d bought while I was away. Mesmerized, I was picking things up and wondering, what the fuck...? Handwoven throws which would make my home look like
a social worker’s. Handwoven bags which had seemed extraordinarily
charming at the time but that I wouldn’t be seen dead with now. A handwoven passport holder. Handwoven oven gloves— back then it hadn’t mattered at all that they weren’t insulated. Funny brass things that might be doorhandles. Or ceremonial cups. A cowbell. Seven Buddhas of varying sizes. A prayer wheel. Awful gaudy wall hangings that you’d see in low-rent Chinese restaurants.
Why, why, why? What had I been thinking? I sat in my handwoven
hell and waited for sanity to return. Which it did.
It has been several weeks since my return. I have not yet purchased
my walking pole.
