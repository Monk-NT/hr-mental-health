I passed my second 80 test today (in Court Reporting) and have promoted to the 100wpm class!  Yay!  My goal was to get out of that class by the end of the quarter.  I was so stressed out about it that I was a ball of anxiety since the quarter ends in almost a week.  My teacher told us to get plenty of rest for the test today because we would do better, so I thought, hmmm...maybe I should just take Seroquel, otherwise I'll only sleep for about 5 hours.  I don't know what worked, maybe practicing 6 hours a day, maybe the sleep, maybe all of it.  But it worked, that's all that matters.  I noticed that there were students who stayed in the 100wpm class for two entire quarters, so I plan on working very hard not to be one of those people.

I was upset at Mark today, maybe it was unwarranted.  I went to bed really early, around 7:30, and woke up at about 4:00am.  I knew he had gone out with his friends in Chicago last night, and he always calls me before he goes to bed.  So I looked at the caller ID to see if I had missed his call, nope, he didn't call at all last night.  He did call my cell phone on my way to school this morning (which was weird because *I* always call *him* on my cell on my way to school), and I asked him about it.  He said that he DID call, but I was out of it and couldn't talk.  I got mad - he told a bold faced lie!  I told him I checked the caller ID and he did NOT call!  I do get upset when he is in Chicago and calls me from the taxi or whatever and I can tell he's drunk or tipsy, but I usually just say "you've had too much to drink, I'm going to go", it annoys me to talk to him when he's like that.  And he only does that in Chicago, not at home.  I don't want this to sound like it's often, it's not, but I'm cautious about his drinking since he had a problem with it years ago.

Anyways, I was pretty mad about him lying about calling me, and then finally he went on the defensive and complained that I was checking up on him, or some kind of excuse.  Typical way for someone to try to get out of something - get mad and turn it around on the other person.  I don't want to keep "tabs" on him, it's just that he ALWAYS calls from Chicago at night before he goes to bed.  And I knew he was going to some kind of bar, which he had termed a "cocktail happy hour" when he told me about it that day.  I said "so you're going to a bar then", I'm not stupid, he can call it whatever he wants, a bar is still a bar. 

So he went to a bar, then didn't call me that night when he always does.  Hmmm.  Well I can't prove anything happened, all I can do is just forget about it, let it go.  I do trust him, I just don't understand why he lied, what was he covering up?  I was definitely more mad about that than him not calling. 

No use in staying mad, nothing can be done, proven, anything.  Life must go on.  He's an adult, he can go out with his friends and I'm totally fine with that, I'm glad he has friends to hang out with, even if it's just in Chicago, or when they come here from Chicago.  And he does invite me to come with him practically every time he goes to Chicago, I just don't go because of school, and he invites me to go out with him and his friends when they're in town, I just choose not to.  So it's not like he's hiding anything.

But the lying about calling me, he's given me no reason about why he did that.  Which really makes me wonder what really happened, even though I do trust him.  There was just no reason to lie if there was nothing to hide.
