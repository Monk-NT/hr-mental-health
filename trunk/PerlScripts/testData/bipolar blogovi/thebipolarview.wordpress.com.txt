I?e descended to the level in mental illness where being able to ?ust do one thing?is a major victory. This post is that one thing.

The good news is that the withdrawal from Cymbalta is mostly over. I have little flare-ups, but the constant and severe symptoms are over. For anyone who? read here, and who is currently going through it, trust me when I say that it will get better. I strongly recommend getting prescription medication for nausea and for cramping if you can. You?l weather the symptoms much more effectively.

That? the end of the good news. I?e slipped into a severe depression. The withdrawal of the antidepressant, plus the stress of Cymbalta withdrawal, and the isolation that? happened since I became disabled, were too much. Lithium (plus an antidepressant) saved my life last time this happened, and it kept me stable (NO severe depressions) for five years. I thought I was safe. You?e never really safe from depression, but lithium made me feel safe and I was grateful for that sense of peace. I? devastated that it? failed.

Now I? back doing the suicide dance. Please note: I am not going to kill myself. Suicide is a complex phenomenon, and the actual killing is the the final stage. I? still at the early stages, where thoughts of death and the futility of life, are frequent. Besides, I made the promise years ago to stay alive, so please don? call the police on me. I?e started a new mood stabilizer, I am in counseling, and as I said, I made that promise way back to stay alive. A new-to-me mood state drastically worsens the suicidal thoughts. I? now experiencing mixed states, a combination of depression and (hypo)mania. You feel the symptoms of both at the same time. In my case, it? feeling suicidal while having so much energy I feel like I? coming out of my skin.

Ugh. The self-centeredness of depression makes the suffering even worse. Thanks to everyone for your kind thoughts, and for checking on me. Sorry for my lack of response.
