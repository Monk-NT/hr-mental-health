I've observed some very interesting behavior that seems to be increasing among the folks I work with. People often use titles and "connections" as tactics to get things done. Sure, one could argue there are times when this is effective to a degree when done tactfully, but most of the time it's unacceptable. 

A few recent incidents/interactions lead me to believe no matter how much education or high the salary, if they're petty and/or passive-aggressive by nature it never changes. This sends up a red flag, one that warns me anytime I interact with this person some bull is bound to ensue. Which in turn spurs my ego as a matter of defense. Wise? Perhaps not, but I have a problem with anyone who tries to steamroll others with razzle dazzle sans any semblance of substance. I believe there's a time when, regardless of age, one should be able to command respect simply by being forthright and mature. 

Maybe one day these character flaws will make them realize how unnecessary and ineffective their actions are. For now I'll avoid the urge to say "grow the f#*k up!" and continue to subliminally yell "act your stage!". 


uick questions for ya...
Should anyone's level of privacy change when in a serious relationship?
Does an unwillingness to share access to one's personal info with their SO always mean there's dishonesty involved?
Is the "need for security" a valid reason for snooping? Or simply insecurity in a thinly veiled disguise?
If you found something (questionable or clear cut), what would you do with the information?
More to come on this, but in the meantime...talk to me...

I never intended to be a Real Housewives of Atlanta junkie, but some of the stuff that goes on is not only ridiculous, but eye-opening. Yep, I'm entertained by the nonsense. This week's "episode" zoomed in on Kim's, the show's resident homewrecker, attempt to record another smash hit (for those who like catchy lyrics mixed with auto-tuned to death chalkboard scratching vocals) with Kandi Burress (y'all know...from the group Xscape). Kim made a bunch of loot off "Tardy for the Party" and, with inflated ego and tone deafness in tow, wants Kandi's help repeating the song's success. 

Well...no matter how many voice lessons Kim takes she will never be able to make a song of substance. How would I know? It's simply a matter of knowing that it requires perfecting what you're gifted with/diligently working on areas of weakness instead of thinking putting in the extra work is not worth the time and effort. Kim's reaction to the suggestion of taking more vocal lessons is a classic example of someone who knows they're mediocre but makes excuses for why they can't lift a finger to improve. Bottom line...if you're not willing to seek continual improvement, whether it's something that's more of a hobby, brings home the bacon or even in your various relationships, expect to remain in the zone of mediocrity and don't complain to others...it makes you look irrational.
