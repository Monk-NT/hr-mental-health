Have you heard about Random Acts of Culture?

Think Mozart at the Food Court. A little tango in an airport terminal. A “Hallelujah” in the shoe department – of the Handel variety, that is.

I heard a guy from the Knight Foundation based in the US speaking on the radio today about how they are helping to produce and fund 1,000 Random Acts of Culture over the next three years, bringing classical artists out of the performance halls, into the streets – and into everyday lives. So if you live in any of these eight cities – Akron, Charlotte, Detroit, Macon, Philadelphia, San Jose, St. Paul and Miami – be on the lookout and have your cellphones ready.

Wow, I think it is the most fantastic concept and hopefully it spreads around the world. Have you seen this video? Six million people have so you may have done. Imagine shopping in Macy's store in Philladelphia (which I have but it was not nearly this exciting) and the next minute......a 650-person performance of Hallelujah. Doubleclick on the video to make it larger (and so you can turn off the ads).


1. It's December 8. How many chocolate Advent Calendars do you think is too many to have opened and eaten already. Mmmm.....I kind of thought so.

2. I was just talking to a guy from the removalist company regarding my parents move. Our conversation got off track and we started talking about things other than moving house. He told me his divorce was far more stressful than moving house and he will never go through that again. He said he recently got engaged and is positive it will be his last wedding. Why? During his first wedding ceremony the Celebrant kept calling his wife to be Kylie instead of Kelly. Even when he corrected her she kept calling her the wrong name. No points for guessing his new fiancees name. Yes, it's Kylie. He thinks it was a sign. I have my fingers and toes crossed for him.

3. Thanks Tashabud for sending me this picture to remind me that some things look better old and grey. Ahhhh......George... how you've changed.



4. This I do not understand. If Julian Assange (Wikileaks) is being given information and publishing it, why is he regarded as a criminal when every other major newspaper across the world is doing the exact same thing. Isn't the US Government (with the support of western governments) trying to shoot the messenger instead of trying to stop the leaks from within their own administration? Plus, after reading some of the documents I'm not sure it is that much of a surprise or the kind of information which could start wars or result in the loss of life. It's just embarrassing because of the scathing personal attacks made on foreign politicians that were never meant to see the light of day. I am sure it will take a while for some relationships to mend. We have all been guilty of that I am sure. Personally, I would be much prefer to see some leaks coming out of Iran or China...now that would be interesting.

5. This is where I will be spending Easter 2011 courtesy of Richard Branson. My daughter won a trip for two to Hong Kong courtesy of her .....Mother. Remember I told you how I take 5 mins or so every once in a while to enter online competitions (for Aussies out there, visit http://www.winfreestuff.com.au/) well I put an entry in for her. I think she felt obliged to take me along. I can hardly say no, can I?

Roll on 2011!!

I have been covering up my premature greys (grays to you in the US) since my late 20s.

It isn’t that obvious because I have fair hair but there is no way I would consider letting the silver take over and have a life of its own. And I cannot even tell you why except I don't quite want to look like my mother.....just yet.

Maybe I am denying the inevitable. After all I can hardly call them premature greys now as most people can expect to have grey hair in their 40s right?

But why is it then that you hardly ever see women in their 30s, 40, 50s and even 60s with grey hair?

I told a friend yesterday that I will give up hair dye and go natural when I am a grandmother (I am hoping that's still a long way off).

My friend who just doesn’t see the fascination for trying to stall the aging process (Botox, hair dyes, expensive skin creams etc.) pointed me in the direction of blogger Michelle Meyer who calculates that she had spent $52,000 in two decades disguising her premature greys and 693 hours in the salon chair. Her website http://www.goinggraylookinggreat.com/ explores potential health risks critics believe are associated with hair dyes - chemicals, such as ammonia and peroxide. It also features the stories of lots of women who have thrown away their hair dye and made the transition to silver (photos included). It's fascinating.

So why do we dye our hair? Do we think we look better or younger hiding the silver? Has anyone taken the plunge and thrown away the hair dye? Or maybe you have never dyed your hair. Why do women worry about it when the majority of men do not. I would love to know your views.
