In the song "Strip Me" by Natasha Bedingfield she has an important message, that one voice can make a difference. One voice that refuses to be silenced is valuable. I wonder how many of us have lost our voice, or have given away due to the critical voices in our head or in our life. I wonder when we started thinking that injustice was okay as long as it was not directed at me.

I am reminded of too many stories where people witnessed horrors such as child abuse, rape, murder, etc and have been silent. They didn't want to get involved or become a target. Well, that is the exact attitude a bully wants you to take. They want you to think you are powerless. They want you to think that you don't make a difference. Well, let me assure you. The woman you stop from being killed by her spouse would probably thank you for making a 911 call. The child that removed from an abusive home would probably thank you too. Maybe they won't thank you in person, but at least you would have done the right thing.

As Elie Wiesel says, "Silence only helps the oppressor." It's time for us to get our voice back.

It seems at the moment the new album "Strip Me" by Natasha Bedingfield is resonating with me. In this song "Recover" Natasha reminds us that yes, we have been through the fire, but we will recover. What is also good is there is not that "get over it" attitude that has become prevalent in our society.

I speak with thousands of people online each week, and the common ground they all have, is they are going through stuff. All handle their stuff differently, but still they are going through. People are lonely, hurting from break ups, relationship stuff, job and financial loss. Some are just coming to find who they are as their former identity has been stripped. Those who held titles as their worth are discovering that a title means little in the end.

So, I remind you that YOU HAVE SURVIVED and you deserve a standing ovation, really. You didn't quit on life, and that means something in this day and age. Thank you for sticking.

2011 is your year to shine bright and be empowered by what is in you.

OK. Totally not a fan of the teenage singer Justin Bieber, but even I have to give credit where it's due on this slowed down version of "U Smile." done by Nick Pittsinger in Tampa, Fla. It makes the song sound, well... check it out for yourself.


It is easy to say "do the right thing" when nothing is on the line, but what if there was,  such as money or a life? Recently I learned this lesson about doing the right thing even if it costs me. I had been hired to do something and from day one there was problem after problem. When the dust settled, it came out that it was clearly my fault, or rather my equipment. So, there is a client that has something unusable, someone else having to do the work, and money on the line.

Hours had been invested, other opportunities had been passed up for this one thing, all to fail big time. Technically I could have pursued my fee, since I did the work, but it did not sit well with    me. I had not delivered what I promised, and it didn't matter who or what was to blame.

It was one of the hardest emails to write waiving my fee, but it was also the most peaceful. Peaceful in that I made a choice that fit in with my values. If greed was my guiding principal then I would have sent a bill without a second thought, but there was a stronger principle at work in me. Integrity.

So, it cost me money and time, but in the end, I still won because I learned that "doing the right thing" sounds good from those who have nothing to lose, but feels good to those who do.
