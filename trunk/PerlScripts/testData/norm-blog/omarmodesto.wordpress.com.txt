New furniture. It’s been arriving for a while new. First the living room got a couch and two chairs, then came some tables and finally a TV cabinet, which I assembled almost singlehandedly. I even had to use a hammer. First time I’ve had to hammer anything with an actual hammer. That was before breaking apart the old TV cabinet by hammering at it at various points, leaving only a pile of termite-ridden, splintery wood that had to be taken out in pieces. It felt good to take out my anger at something. My mother took the chance to get rid of various CDs, VHS tapes and cassettes that were in the old cabinet, and only a few made it into the new one.

Cleaning up. Everyone but my brother has been throwing away things, especially from the back room which is used for storage. For a while, there was plenty more space in that room, in which Kondoleza the dog spends most of her day. I’ve already been doing my share of throwing things away, starting last year. It took a while for everyone else to follow up on that.

Painting. My mother has been buying these large frames and she’s been making me paint the background of them in black, to place some nature photos in them. The first one, with two river photos, turned out all right. The second one, with flowers from an old calendar not so much. She wants me to do a third one which will house just one big photo. It’s been a good chance to use the remaining art supplies from college, namely the black paint. I also painted some bars on the balcony railing. As it turns out, they bought the wrong shade of gold and now the entire thing might need to be fully repainted.

More new furniture. My sister got an expensive bedroom set. Good for her, I guess, but I found it rather upsetting. Not only does the bedroom set not fit in her rather small bedroom in which her toddler son also sleeps, but it’s almost as if she’s settling in even further, when she should be doing the opposite. One would think that after nearly three years of getting married, she’d have her own place, with her husband, and her son would have a bedroom of his own (something that I’ve never had). Her old bedroom furniture is in the back room, taking the recently-unoccupied space.

The growing child. My nephew, my sister’s son, will be three years old next year. Already there’s talk of turning his crib into a bed, which will give him the freedom of getting out of it and running around the apartment whenever he pleases. I’m always trying to find a quiet place in which to read, or just think, but now he’ll be everywhere. He can open doors, he can yell, he can usually get his way like only a child can. Looks like it will still be a while before I ever get to know these things called privacy, peace and quiet beyond their dictionary definitions.

Upcoming guests. Some relatives from abroad will be staying here for about a week, which I guess is the main reason for my mother doing all these changes around the place. They’re from her side of the family, and they’ve stayed here many times before, but I don’t know why this time calls for an even more intensive cleanup and rearrangement of everything in the apartment. It’s usually just scrubbing the walls, but changing every other piece of furniture is a bit too much.

Through the pages. Reading is one of the few pleasures I’ve got left. I already talked about Juvenilia by Miguel Cané, an edition printed in 1984 which had been here forever and that I finally decided to read to see if it was anything like what the title and the cover artwork indicated (and it was, to an extent). Now, I’ve moved on to reading Doce cuentos peregrinos –literally Twelve pilgrim tales, but published in English as Strange Pilgrims for some reason– by Gabriel García Márquez. It’s my introduction to the work of this Nobel laureate, and I’m loving it so far. Last I checked, there were some other books of his authorship in the very bookshelf on which this laptop currently rests, so I’ll have to look and see if they’re still here.

The vibe. My previous post began with a short plug for SocialVibe, a social networking service that allows people to pick a cause and do various activities with the aim of earning points, which result in donations to that cause. I’ve had the SocialVibe badge on this blog for well over a year now, but it was only last week that I decided to actually register and help Charity: Water reach their goal of providing 3.6 million gallons of clean water to those who need it. Once again, you can help by clicking on the SocialVibe badge on the right, clicking here and doing some activities or registering and picking your favorite cause to support.

Aside from the last two paragraphs, the events of the past two weeks have made this place feel different … or, wait, I think it has mostly made me feel out of place. Everyone else has things to do, they’ve got lives of their own, and they’ve got their health. I’ve always been the one who stays here and, after all the changes that are taking place in this shrinking apartment, there are even less reasons to refer to it as “home”. They come back to it after a day of doing things, while I witness all the change and dwell in it. It’s home to them, but I don’t really get a say in what goes on in it, in what changes are made. I’m just another guest here, on a very extended stay.

I close my eyes and I try, I give it my best, to picture myself living in my own place, being in full health as I should always have been, and having more than just a mere existence. But I can’t, either because I’m interrupted by the surrounding noise of everyone and everything or simply because I lack the imagination to create a world, in my mind, in which I can live and do things that make me happy.

What are those things? What makes me happy? I like reading, for sure. I like writing here. I like sitting in silence with my thoughts and staring at the evening sky when I step outside. None of that does more than provide a temporary escape from this existence. I wish I could go back and tell my much-younger self to do things differently or, better yet, provide him with an entire notebook of DOs an DON’Ts which he can use for reference. That would be swell, but the past is the past.

There’s another year, not far away. Whatever it may bring, I’m reaching out, with my arms fully extended and my hands closing at intervals, hoping to catch more than just air and the occasional flying insect … anything better, I’ll gladly take.


So, this is December …

I skipped posting for World AIDS Day, but that one post I made is still valid as the situation hasn’t changed that much. There’s also that SocialVibe thing on the right … Haiti is still in dire need of everything, especially now with the ongoing cholera outbreak. If you’re reading this at any moment, please take a few minutes to click on the SocialVibe widget and follow the instructions or, better yet, join SocialVibe!

Back to what I was writing …

The living room is much less recognizable with the new furniture that’s been delivered. Currently, two chairs and a couch. The old couch is gone for good. The two chairs we had, along with the rocking chair from the balcony, have been repaired and painted (or just heavily varnished). There are two boxes with new tables that have yet to be assembled and, just yesterday, my father removed that phone from the wall and simply threw it in the trash.

I tried my best not to protest, simply uttering that the phone should stay there, a few times, and I wasn’t going to take it out of the garbage, as it was already broken into pieces at the bottom of the trash bag, which I threw away this morning. The space previously occupied by that phone, which still displays the original paint color of the apartment, will apparently become the home for a small wine rack.

Our night watchman was assaulted the other day. A military man, he was riding his motorcycle on his way home when two or more men pulled a wire or rope from both sides of the street, which he caught just at neck level, making him fall from his bike. He went to the hospital to get checked and won’t be back to work, at least for a while. He came here today and was greeted by a few neighbors who told him that he was lucky to have survived, and so on. I didn’t say anything, but if he wasn’t wearing a helmet at the time of the incident, I’ll suggest he buy one. Criminals tend to get creative at this time of the year …

Just today, a woman from the apartment building decided to start preaching. She stopped a neighbor before entering the building. That neighbor, being the nice and patient lady that she is, stood there for a while as the preacher said a few things out loud and even started singing a religious tune. The neighbor had to move on, so the preacher went about finding others who would listen. I closed the laptop, took two of the dogs –leaving Droopy, the more quiet one– and went to the bedroom, so that I wouldn’t be seen if she happened to walk in front of the balcony (it’s the ground level, so everyone can see a bit of the living room). Didn’t want to confront her or be confronted, being an atheist and all.

Apparently, this woman preacher is a housekeeper from upstairs who suddenly decided to let the religious talk fly. She even stopped our visiting guardsman and preached to him from her balcony as he stood in the sun, still with fresh wounds on his face and neck, and then went on to another neighbor who was walking there with his four sons. After the parking lot was clear of potential preachees (not an actual word), I could still hear her voice coming from upstairs. I hope that this is only a phase and not something that will be seen/heard every day from now on.

What else … ah, yes. Juvenilia. I already wrote plenty about it, but I didn’t really go beyond the actual content of the book, choosing instead to save that for later … which is now. Throughout some of the book, particularly during the introduction, its author, Miguel Cané,  writes about some bright fellow students from his years at the school who were overcome with the real world and didn’t live up to the potential they had back then. Once again, that got me thinking.

As I read the introduction of the book, a scene came to my mind. In it, a man in his early- to mid-twenties is sitting in a public place, plenty of tables and occupied chairs. The young man says, to the people at his table, that things in life didn’t turn out the way he hoped they would and that it’s too late for him. He had potential and it all went to waste. Suddenly, a person sitting at another table, just behind him, turns around and says something along the lines of “You’re stupid. Too late for you? You’ve only been out of school for [single-digit amount] years and you’re only [a number between 20 to 25]. If you were two or three times that age, your comments would have some value. But, right now, you’ve got all the time in the world and plenty to work with.” Then, the person turns around, as does the young man who listened to all of this, and the scene ends.

There’s part of me that wishes it were me, sitting there, listening to such a scolding. The other person has probably learned that lesson the hard way and is looking to pass it on, to someone who can still do something about things, who could use the early advice, who still has the chance to live as good a life as one can live.

I’m still not 100% well –will I ever be?–, and I’m not sure which of all of the prescribed medications did the most work, be it alone or in combination, but I’m not as bad as in the last few weeks. I hope that I don’t roll back to where I was when they all run out and that I just stay on the same hill I’ve been climbing, slowly but surely. Maybe this will be the year in which my health problems disappear forever and I can finally start living … or maybe not. I’ll have to wait and see …
