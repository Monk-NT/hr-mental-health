Every year, I seem to struggle more.  Christmas was my favorite holiday as a child and as an adult.  When I had children, I wanted to make it amazingly special for them.  It had to be beautiful and special, not with toys or things, but with memories and activities and stories and family.

In 2001, my husband died and it became more difficult to muster the energy to decorate.  Things were not the same.  Someone was missing and we all knew it.  It was weird.  The effort to “make things the same” was wasted because we knew it would never be the same.  Then I tried to make things totally different.  That didn’t work either and ended in tears.  We couldn’t “fix it”.

We did try to get rid of the material items that meant nothing and tried to make memories.  We replaced the material things with trips each year – a cruise, Disney World, New York, a cabin in the Smoky Mountains.  That was a good decision.  We have great memories of those times.

The kids got older and got jobs and significant others in their lives.  It was hard to coordinate time off and for them to miss work for a trip during the holiday.  It became a dance of schedules and often left us a two hour window to open presents and eat before one had to go to work and the other had to attend the significant other’s family dinner and present opening.


But we still had family with us.  Either we headed to Alabama to visit my husband’s family or to Middle Tennessee to visit my family.  My siblings are spread across the country so it didn’t happen every year but there were a few occasions over the years that we were all at my parent’s house at the same time.  Then my mom passed away.  Again, it was different.  Someone was missing and there was no getting around it
.
We tried to make it the same.  Then we tried to make it different, holding Christmas at my house for Dad and my sister’s family from Louisiana.  Then everyone else’s kids got older again and it became more difficult to get everyone in one place at the same time both in Alabama and for my family.  Last year Dad couldn’t make it to my house but my sister’s family did.  This year, I think it’s going to be almost impossible to get any of us together.  My daughter is living in Atlanta working two jobs and my son works almost every holiday.  At least they will be home for most of Christmas Day.

Hence my lack of Christmas Spirit.  I am really not whining or feeling sorry for myself.  I have a very close extended family and I realize every family goes through this.  It’s my turn.  I love tradition and family and stories and memories and food and games and will miss the loud discussions, the large personalities, the quiet moments, the sharing of love and family.  But we will make all that happen again in a new way, maybe at Christmas, maybe at New Year’s, or maybe even in the summer months.

My son has his tree up downstairs and it’s different and beautiful – totally him.  My daughter has a cute tree in her apartment in Atlanta that expresses her personality and colorful sense of design.  Do I have to put up a tree?  I think I do.  I could sit here all day and wait for the holiday spirit to come and anoint me with the magic of Christmas.  I might be sitting a long time.  I think it will happen once I start the decorating, starting with the tree.

And yes, I will complain that I have to drag out all that stuff, find a place to store the “stuff” that is a part of the décor all year, and then clean up everything.  And I will whine that all that has to be done again in reverse in a few weeks.  But I will do it.

Christmas changes and I need to change my expectations.  I’m working on it.


This picture is from the Maryville Daily Times, just over in the next county but these signs are all over the East Tennessee area, all with different names to be shamed.

The signs began popping up around Knoxville well over a year ago and I paid them little mind until one showed up just down the street from my neighborhood.  The sign and the two people sitting with it were positioned on a main road, up against a brick wall, across from a middle income neighborhood.  The sign obviously named someone who lived in the neighborhood across from where the sign and it’s handlers were positioned.

I was curious about the situation since all the signs have different names to be shamed.  I began to look into it on-line and learned that all the protests were being organized by a local carpenters union and they are protesting the use of non-union carpenters by local developers

The interesting thing is that none of the names on the signs are developers.  In fact, the name on the sign above is the mayor of Maryville.  In this case, there is city money being paid to a developer who uses non-union carpenters and the union objects.  The mayor represents the city so his name goes up on the sign.  No one driving by even knows who the developer is.

My effort to bring this up is NOT to discuss union practices or the labor issues that have arisen from this.  I am just wondering how effective they are with this type of protest.

For the last year, I have driven by these signs and paid them little mind.  As the weather changed, I worried about the people being out in the extreme heat or cold.  I figured they must be pretty dedicated and believe in their cause but that was the extent of me thinking about the cause.

Today, as I drove on my way to work, I passed the sign close to my neighborhood.  There were two people with the sign, one sitting on each end, as always.  But today, on one end, there was a person in a reclining lawn chair leaned all the way back, covered by blankets and an umbrella.  I couldn’t see if the person was male or female but I COULD see that they were asleep.  At the other end of the sign was someone in another chair, wearing a gray hoodie with the hood pulled around their face, slumped over to the side, asleep.  Don’t these people have lives?

I began to think of the ridiculousness of it all.  The signs have the name of a person that is not directly responsible for what they are protesting.  No one knows what it is they are protesting.  If you ask, you are told “we can’t say anything except it’s a labor dispute”.  These people are sleeping on the side of a main highway in horrible weather guarding a sign that no one understands and they won’t explain.

Is this really the best way to get your message out?
