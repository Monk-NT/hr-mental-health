Random: It comes up quite often – my complete inability to accessorize. I’ve never really been able to pull it off. Back when my career was very corporate-y, I had a (friendly, trying to be helpful) colleague tell me that I’d look more professional AND feminine if I wore jewelry. So I went out and bought a lot of very small, cheap, barely noticeable earrings and necklaces. All very un-bling and boring.

Anyway, that was a million years ago and I haven’t worn any of that jewelry in ages. In recent years, I’m almost always seen wearing a single pendant. Not always the same one. I have a small collection. I bought the first one myself, and several since. And others have been purchased as gifts.

A couple by men.

Smart men who knew me well enough (or who were observant enough) to see that I wear pendants all of the time and so, I must really like them. BTW, one of my golden rules of breakups is: lose the guy, chuck his stuff, KEEP THE JEWELRY!

I’m new-pendant-less this year. I haven’t bought any for myself (I tend to buy them when I’m out of town, to remind me of the trip) and haven’t had any real boyfriends all year.

So, that’s what I’m putting on my Xmas wish list. A guy who’ll buy me a pendant. Not because I can’t buy my own damn pendant. But because I want a guy who likes me enough to want to, and who knows me well enough to know what I’d like.

Speaking of which…



I took a quick browse through the Ice.com store this morning and this one caught my eye. Very LBD appropriate. I don’t know, though, there were lots of others I liked, too.

As luck would have it, the good folks over at Ice.com are running a special friends and family promotion for my readers (and the readers of some other amazing sites).

I’ll admit it, I’ve been sucking at the online dating thing lately. To be honest, I’ve just been overwhelmed with life, work and health stuff since the beginning of the month.

I want to date. I just haven’t been making the time. Instead, I’ve been letting messages sit in my online dating inbox, unanswered. Which is rude. And stupid.

I’ll also admit that one of the reasons I’ve let dating fall so low on my priority list is that most of the guys I’m getting messages from live in the burbs (the messages get forwarded to my email, so I know they’re there without having to login to the site).  And, as I’ve written about before, I’m a city chick with ZERO desire to move out to the burbs. I don’t see myself ever having a big white house and a white picket fence.  So when I get messages from guys who are living the suburban dream, I tend to be unenthusiastic. Or less enthusiastic than if they lived in a cramped studio somewhere in the city.

Which is what it is. Maybe it’s silly that I’m discounting so many potentially great guys. Or maybe it’s practical since it’s unlikely that any of them would want to move into the city and I’m not interested in ever moving to the burbs.

Which leads me to today’s poll question.  I know that my situation is specific to New Yorkers and other city dwellers, but that all daters have somewhat similar issues (if I lived in the country I’d have to drive a potentially long distance for dating) – How long will you travel for a date?  Whether it be online dating or a friend of a friend or someone you’re being set up with by a matchmaker, what’s your limit? Would it be OK if that person lived an hour away?  What about 90 minutes?  2 hours?  How far would you travel for potential love? I’m putting these measure in increments of time instead of miles.


I was supposed to have a date this weekend. And another tonight.

Supposed to.

They were going to be my first 2 dates in months. But no. Both were cancelled. And this is why (some) people hate dating.

I don’t, for the record, hate dating. No usually.  But some days…

Here’s the story: I crawled out from under my dating rock last week and immediately received a message from some guy I went out with, once, many years ago. I don’t really remember him but he remembers me. I decided to view that neutrally. We exchanged several emails and then spoke on the phone and made plans to get together this past weekend.

Now, I’m not a big fan of reruns. I figure, if we didn’t have a great date the first time, why bother?  But it was a really long time ago and I don’t even remember meeting him. So no harm/no foul. And it would be good to just get back out there, y’know? But then, I don’t hear back from him with concrete plans til Saturday late in the morning, when he texted me to ask if I was available to get together early that afternoon.

Um, no. Because a) I was busy and b) I’m pretty much never going to be available to some guy I don’t know who says, “how about you drop what you’re doing and meet me for coffee in a couple of hours.”

So that date isn’t going to happen after all.

The other is equally stupid and frustrating. There’s this guy (who I think might know about the blog, *sigh*) I went out with a few times a few years ago. And he’s been asking me out every few months since then. And I always say no. Not because there’s anything wrong with him. He’s a perfectly nice guy. I just don’t see him and I ever turning into anything. ANYTHING.

I don’t even think he really likes me. It’s just about getting me to say yes, at this point. So last week, out of the blue, I got one of his texts. And I figured, why not?  So I said, yes.  And he suggested Monday night (tonight). And I said, yes.  So yesterday I got a text from him with his availability for the week (as if I hadn’t already said yes to a specific night).  Monday night was not one of the times he was available.

My yes has now turned to a, you’ve gotta be fuckin kidding me. I’m fairly certain that this proved my theory. That he just wanted to get me to say yes. Not to actually go out with me. Or my other theory, that he’s not the kind of guy I could ever be into, because he can’t even plan a proper date.

And so…  I’m back to the drawing board.  Another weekend/week without a date.  Ho-hum.

In other news, just took and uploaded some new online profile pics.  So we’ll see what we happens.
