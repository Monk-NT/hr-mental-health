I scanned the wine rack for a nice bottle of red. Marino sucked smoke and exhaled loudly. He had
nothing more to say about Rocky than he ever had.
"One of these days you're going to talk to me about him," I said as I poured crushed tomatoes in a pot.
"You know as much about him as you need to," he said.
"You love him, Marino."
"I'm telling you, I don't love him. I wish he'd never been born. I wish I'd never met him."
He stared out the window at my backyard fading into night. This moment I didn't seem to know Marino
at all. He was a stranger in my kitchen, this man in uniform ;who had a son I'd never met and knew
nothing about. Marino wouldn't look me in the eye or thank me when I set a cup of coffee on his place
mat.
"How about ,peanuts or something?" I asked.
"Naw," he said. "I been thinking about going on a diet."
"Thinking about it won't help much. It's been proven in studies."
"You gonna wear garlic around your neck or something when you post our dead werewolf? You know,
you get bit by one, you turn into one. Sort of: like AIDS."
"It's nothing like AIDS, and I wish you'd get off this AIDS thing."
"You think he wrote that on the box himself?"
"We can't assume that box and what was written on it are connected with him, Marino."

"Have a nice trip, werewolf. Yeah, you find that written on camera boxes all the time. Especially when
they're near dead bodies."
"Let's get back to Bray and your new fashion statement," I said. "Start from the beginning. What did you
do to make her such a fan?"
"It started about two weeks after she got here. Remember that autoerotic hanging?"
“Yes”.
"She shows up and just walks right into the middle of everything and starts telling people what to do, like
she's the detective. She starts looking through the porno magazines the guy was having fun with when he
strung himself up in his leather mask. She starts asking his wife questions."
"Whoa," I said.
"So I tell her to leave, that she's in the way and screwing up everything, and the next day she calls me
into her office. I figure she's going to be tear-ass about what happened, but she doesn't say a word.
Instead, she asks what I think of the detective division."
He took a gulp of coffee and stirred in two more teaspoons of sugar.
"Thing is, I could tell that really wasn't what she was interested in;" he went on. "I knew she wanted
something. She wasn't in charge of investigations, so why the hell was she asking me about the detective
division?"
I poured myself a glass of wine.
"Then what did she want?" I asked.
"She wanted to talk about you. She started asking me a thousand questions about you, said she knew
we had been `partners in crime,' as she put it, for a long time."
I checked the dough, then the sauce.
"She was asking me background stuff. What the cops thought of you."
"And what did you say?"
"I told her you was a doctor-lawyer-Indian chief with an IQ bigger than my paycheck, that the cops was
all in love with you, including the women. And let's see, what else?"
"That was probably quite enough."
"She asked aboutBentonand what happened to him and how much it had affected your work."
Anger heated me up.
"She starting quizzing me about Lucy. About why she left the FBI and if the way she swings is the
reason."

"This woman's fast sealing her fate with me," I warned.
"I told her Lucy left the Bureau because NASA asked her to become an astronaut;" Marino kept going.
"But when she got into the space program, she decided she liked flying helicopters better and signed on
as a pilot for ATE Bray wanted me to tell her next time Lucy was in town, to arrange for- the two of
them to meet because Bray might want to recruit her. I said that was sort of like asking Billie Jean King
to be a ball girl. End of story? I didn't tell Bray shit except I ain't your social secretary. One week later,
my ass was back in uniform."
I reached for my pack and felt like a junkie. We shared an ashtray, smoking in my house, silent and
frustrated. I was trying not to feel hateful.
"I think she's jealous as hell of you, plain and simple, Doe," Marino finally said. "She's the big shot
moving here from D.C., and all she hears about is the great Dr. Scarpetta. And I think she got a cheap
thrill out of busting up the two of us. Gave the bitch a little power rush."
He smashed the cigarette butt in the ashtray and ground it out.
"This is the first time you and me haven't worked together since you moved here;' he said as the doorbell
rang for a second time this night.
"Who the hell's that?" he said. "You invite someone else and not tell me?"
I got up and looked into the video screen of the Aiphone on the kitchen wall. I stared, incredulous,
at-the images picked up by the front-door camera.
"I'm dreaming," I said.

Lucy and Jo seemed apparitions, physical presences that could not be flesh and blood. Both of them had
been riding the streets ofMiamibarely eight hours ago. Now they were in my arms.
"I don't know what to say," I said at least five times as they dropped duffel bags on the floor.
"What the hell's going on?" Marino boomed, intercepting us in the great room. "What do you think
you're doing here?" he demanded of Lucy, as if she had done something wrong.
He had never been able to show affection in a normal way. The gruffer and more sarcastic he got, the
happier he was to see my niece.
"'They fire your ass down there already?" he asked.
"What's this, trick or treat?" Lucy said just as loudly, tugging a sleeve of his uniform shirt. "You trying to
make us finally believe you're a real cop?"
"Marino," I said as we went into the kitchen, "I don't think you've met Jo Sanders."

"Nope," he said.
"You've heard me talk about her."
He gave Jo a blank look. She was an. athletically built strawberry blonde with dark blue eyes, and I
could tell he thought she was pretty.
"He knows exactly who you are," I said to Jo. "He's not being rude. He's just being him."
"You work?" Marino asked her, fishing his smoldering cigarette out of the ashtray and drawing one last
puff.
"Only when I have no choice," Jo- answered.
"Doing what?"
"A little rappelling out of Black Hawks. Drug busts. Nothing special."
"Don't tell me you and Lucy are in the same field division down there inSouth America."
"She's DEA," Lucy told him.
"No shit?" Marino said to Jo. "You seem kind of puny for DEA: "
"They're into quotas," Jo said.
He opened the refrigerator and shoved things around until he found a Red Stripe beer. He twisted off the
cap and started chugging.
"Drinks are on the house," he called out.
"Marino," I said. "What are you doing? You're on duty."
"Not anymore. Here, let me show you."
He set the bottle down hard on the table and dialed a number.
"Mann, what'cha know," he said into the phone. "Yeah, yeah. Listen, I ain't joking. I'm feeling like shit.
You think you could cover for me tonight? I'll owe ya:'
Marino winked at us. He hung up, hit the speaker button on the phone and dialed again. His call was
answered on the first ring.
"Bray;" the deputy chief of administration, Diane Bray, announced in my kitchen for all to hear.
"Deputy Chief Bray, it's Marino," he said in the voice of someone dying of a terrible scourge. "Really
sorry to bug you at home."
He was answered with silence, having instantly and deliberately irritated his direct supervisor by
addressing her as "Deputy Chief." According to protocol; deputy chiefs were always addressed as
"Chief," while the chief himself was called "Colonel." Calling her at home didn't win him any points, either.

"What is it?" Bray tersely asked.
"I feel like hell," Marino rasped. "Throwing up, fever, the whole nine yards. I gotta mark off sick and go
to bed."
"You certainly weren't sick when I saw you a few hours ago.,,
"It happened real sudden. I sure hope I didn't catch some bacteria thing. . ."
I quickly dashed out Strep and Clostridia on a notepad.
". . . you know, like strep or Clos-ter-ida out there at the scene. One doctor I called warned me about
that, because of getting in such close proximity to that dead body and all...
"When does your shift end?" she interrupted him.
"Eleven."
Lucy, Jo and I were red-faced, strangled by laughter we were fighting to hold in.
"It's not likely I can find someone to be watch commander this late in the shift," Bray coldly replied.
"I already got hold of Lieutenant Mann in third precinct. He's nice enough to work the rest of tour for
me," Marino let her know as his health failed precipitously.
