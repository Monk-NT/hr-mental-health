I didn't care. It no longer mattered.
"Of course, you can't do much with the hairs," she rambled. "Hirsute, no pigmentation. They would
simply be consistent with each other, wouldn't they . . . ?"
I wasn't listening. I was thinking of Kaspar Hauser. He spent the first sixteen years of his life in a
dungeon because Prince Charles of Baden wanted to make sure Kaspar didn't have any claims to the
crown:
". . . no DNA without roots, I suppose . . ." Dr. Stvan went on. '
At age sixteen he was found by a gate, a note pinned to him. He was pale like a cave fish, nonverbal like
an animal. A freak. He couldn't even write his name without someone's guiding his hand.
"The mechanical, block letters of a beginner," I thought out loud. "Someone shielded, never exposed to
others, never schooled except at home. Maybe even self-taught.".
Dr. Stvan stopped talking.
"Only a family could shield someone from the time he was born. Only a very powerful family could
circumvent the legal system, allowing this anomaly to keep on killing without being caught. Without
embarrassing them, drawing unwanted attention to them."
Dr. Stvan was silent as every word I said torqued what she believed and aroused a new, more pervasive
fear.
"The Chandonne family knows exactly what these hairs, the abnormal teeth, all of it means," I said. "And
he knows. Of course he does, and he would have to suspect you know, even if the labs tell you nothing,
Dr. Stvan. I think he came to your house because you saw his reflection in what he did to the bodies.
You saw his shame, or he thought you did."
"Shame.. . ?"
"I don't think the purpose of that note was to assure you he wouldn't try again," I continued. "I think it
was mocking you, telling you he could do what he wanted with sovereign immunity. That he would be
back and wouldn't fail next time."
"But it would appear he's not here anymore," Dr. Stvan answered me.
"Obviously, something changed his plans."
"And the shame he thinks I saw? I never got a good look at him."
"What he did to his victims is the only look at him we need. The hair isn't coming from his head," I said.
"He's shedding it from his body."

I had seen only one case of hypertrichosis in my life, when I was a resident physician in Miami and
rotating through pediatrics. A Mexican woman gave birth to a girl, and two days later the infant was
covered with a fine lightgray hair almost two inches long. Thick tufts protruded from her nostrils and ears,
and she was photophobic, her eyes overly sensitive to light.
In most hypertrichotic .people, hairiness progressively increases until the only areas spared are mucous
membranes and palms and soles, and in some extreme cases, unless the person frequently shaves, the
hair on,the face and brow can become so long it has to be curled so the person can see. Other symptoms
can be anomalies of the teeth, stunted genitalia, more than the normal number of fingers and toes and
nipples, and an asymmetrical face.
In earlier centuries, some of these wretched souls were sold to carnivals or royal courts for amusement.
Some were thought to be werewolves.
"Wet, dirty hair. Like a wet, dirty animal," Dr. Ruth Stvan supposed. "I wonder if the reason I saw only
his eyes when he appeared at my door is because his entire face was covered with hair? And maybe he
had his hands in his pockets because they were covered with hair, too?"
"Certainly, he couldn't go out in normal society looking like that," I replied. "Unless he goes out only after
dark. Shame, sensitivity to light and now murder. He might limit his activities to darkness, anyway."
"I suppose he could shave," Stvan pondered. "At least those areas people might see. Face, forehead,
neck, tops of the hands."
"Some of the hair we found appeared to have been shaved," I said. "If he were on a ship, he had to do
something. "He must undress, at least partially, when he kills," she said.
"All this long hair he leaves."
I wondered if his genitalia were stunted, and if this might have something to do with why he undressed
his victims only from the waist up. Perhaps to see normal adult female genitalia was'to remind him of his
own inadequacy as a male. I could only imagine his humiliation, his rage. It was typical for parents to shun
a hypertrichotic infant at birth, especially if they were like the powerful, proud Chandonnes on the rich,
exclusive he Saint-Louis.
I imagined this tormented son, this espéce de sale gorille, living in a dark space inside his family's
centuriesold home and going out only at night. Criminal cartel or not, a wealthy family with a respected
name might not want the world to know he was their son.
"There's always the hope record checks can be run in France to see if there have been any babies born
with this condition," I said. "That shouldn't be hard to track, since hypertrichosis is so rare. Only one in a
billion people, or something like that."
"There will be no records," Stvan matter-of-factly stated.
I believed her. His family would have made certain of that. Close to noon, I left Dr. Stvan with fear in my
heart and ill-gotten-evidence in my briefcase. I went out through the back of the building, where vans
with curtains in the windows waited for their next sad journey. A man and a woman in the drab clothing

of sparrows waited on a black bench against the old brick wall. He held his hat in his hand, staring down
at the ground. She looked up at me, her face pinched by grief.
I walked very fast on cobblestones along the Seine as terrible images came to me. I imagined his hideous
face flashing out of the dark when a woman opened her door to him. I imagined him wandering like a
nocturnal beast, selecting and stalking until he struck and savaged again and again. His revenge in life was
to make his victims look at him. His power was their terror.
I stopped and scanned. Cars were relentless and fast. I felt dazed as traffic roared and kicked grit in my
face, and I had no idea how I was going to get a taxi. There was no place for one to pull over. Side
streets I passed were empty of traffic and I saw no hope of a taxi along any of them, either.
I began to get a panic attack. I fled back up stone steps, back into the park, and sat on a bench,
catching my breath while the scent of death continued to drift through flowers and trees. I closed my eyes
and turned my face up to the winter sun, waiting for my heart to run a little slower while beads of cold
sweat slid under my clothes. My hands and feet were numb, my aluminum briefcase hard between my
knees.
"You look like you could use a friend." Jay Talley's voice suddenly sounded above me.
I jumped and gasped.
"I'm sorry," he softly said as he sat next to me. "I didn't mean to startle you."
"What are you doing here?" I asked as thoughts madly clashed, muddy and bloody and slamming into
one another like foot soldiers on a battlefield.
"Didn't I tell you we'd look after you?"
He unbuttoned his tobacco-colored cashmere overcoat and slipped out a pack of cigarettes from an
inside pocket. He lit one for each of us.
"You also said it was too dangerous for any of you to show up here," I said accusatorially. "So I go in
and do my dirty work, and here you are, sitting in the damn park right at the Institut's damn front door."
I angrily blew out smoke and got to my feet. I grabbed my briefcase.
"Just what kind of game are you playing with me?" I asked him.
He dipped into another pocket and pulled out a cellular phone.
"I thought you might need a ride," he said. "I'm not playing a game. Let's go."
He pressed numbers on his phone and said something in French to whoever was at the other end.
"Now what? Is the Man from U.N.C.L.E. coming to pick us up?" I bitterly said.
"I just called a taxi. I believe the Man from U.N.C.L.E. retired a few years ago."
We walked out to one of the quiet side streets, and minutes later a taxi pulled over. We climbed in and
Talley stared at the briefcase in my lap.
"Yes," I answered his unspoken question.
When we reached my hotel, I took him up to my room, because there was no other place we could talk
without the risk of being overheard. I tried Marino, and he didn't answer.
"I need to get back to Virginia," I said.
"That's easy enough to arrange," he said. "Whenever you want."
He hung the do not disturb sign outside the door and fastened the burglar chain.
"First thing in the morning."
We settled in the sitting area by the window, a small table between us.
"I take it Madame Stvan opened up to you," he said. "That was the harder nut to crack, if you must
know. By now the poor woman's so paranoid-and for good reason-we didn't think she'd tell the truth to
anyone. I'm glad my instincts were right."
"Your instincts?" I asked.
"Yes." His eyes stayed on mine. "I knew, if anyone could get through to her, it would be you. Your
reputation precedes you and she can't have anything but the utmost respect for you. But it helps just a
little that I have personal insight about you, too." He paused. "Because of Lucy."
"You know my niece?" I didn't believe him.
"We were in various training programs at the same time in Glynco," he replied, referring to the national
academy in Glynco, Georgia, where ATF, Customs, Secret Service, Border Patrol and some sixty other
law enforcement agencies did their basic training. "I used to feel kind of song for her, in a way. Her
presence always managed to generate a lot of talk about you, as if she didn't have any talents on her
own."
"I can't do a tenth of what she can," I said.
"Most people can't."
"What does any of this have to do with her?" I wanted to know.
"I think she has to be Icarus and fly too close to the sun because of you. I hope she doesn't push that
myth too far and fall from the sky,"
The comment shot fear through me. I had no idea what Lucy was doing right now. Talley was right
about what he said, too. My niece always had to do everything bigger, better, faster and riskier than I
did, as if competing against me would finally win the love she didn't believe she deserved.
"Hair transferred from the killer to his victims in the Paris cases is definitely not the hair of the unidentified
man in my cooler," I said, and I explained the rest to him.
"But this weird hair was on his clothes?" Talley tried to understand.
"On the inside of them. Just think of this as a hypothetical. Let's say the clothing was worn by the killer
and his body is covered with this dense, long baby-fine hair. Só it transfers to the inside of his clothing,
which he takes off and makes his victim put on before he drowns him."
"The victim being the guy in the container. Thomas." Talley paused. 'This hair's all over Loup-Garou's
body? Then he obviously doesn't shave it:'
"It wouldn't be easy shaving your entire body on a regular basis. Most likely, he shaves only those areas
people might see:'
"And there's no effective treatment. No drug or anything."
"Lasers are being used with some success. But he may not know that. Or more likely, his family wasn't
going to permit him to show up at a clinic, especially after he started killing."
"Why do you think he exchanged clothes with the man you found in the container? With Thomas."
"If you're going to escape on a ship," I surmised, "you wouldn't want to be in designer clothes, assuming
your theory about the hand-me-downs is true. It could also be spite, contempt. Getting in the last word.
We could speculate all day long, but there's never a formula, only the damage left behind:'
"Can I get you anything?" he asked.
"An answer," I said. "Why didn't you tell me Dr. Stvan was the one who survived? You and the
secretary-general sat there telling me this story when you knew all along it was she you were talking
about:'
Talley was silent.
"You were afraid it would scare me off, weren't you?" I said. "The Loup-Garou sees her and tries to kill
her, so maybe he would see me and try to kill me, too?"
"Various people involved were doubtful you would go see her if you knew the whole story."
"Well, then these various people don't know me very well," I said. "In fact, I would be more likely to go
if I knew something like that. The 'hell with how well you think you know me and can predict this and that
after having met Lucy one or two times."
"Kay, it was because of Dr. Stvan's insistence. She wanted to tell you herself for a very good reason.
She'd never divulged all of the details to anyone, not even the detective who is her friend. He was only
able to supply us with a rough sketch." ,
Why?
"Again, the people protecting the killer. If they somehow found out and thought she might have gotten a
good look at him, she was afraid they might do something to her. Or to her husband- or two children.
She believed you wouldn't betray her by talking to anyone who might place her in a vulnerable position.
But in terms of how much she told you, she said she wanted to make that decision when she was with
you."

"In case she didn't trust me after all."
"I knew she would."
"I see. So mission accomplished."
"Why are you so angry with me?" he asked.
"Because you're so presumptuous."
"I don't mean to be," he said. "I just want us to stop this werewolf-freak before he kills and mutilates
anybody else. I want to know what makes him tick:"
"Fear and avoidance," I said. "Suffering and rage because he was punished for something that wasn't his
fault. He anguished alone. Imagine being intelligent enough to comprehend all that."
"He would hate his mother most," Talley said. "He might even blame her."
Sunlight polished his hair like ebony and caught his eyes at the edge, flecking them with gold. I saw his
feelings before he could rush them back into hiding. I got up and looked out the window because I did
not want to look at him.
"He would hate women he sees," Talley said. "Women he could never have. Women who would scream
in horror if they saw him, saw his body."
"Most of all, he would hate himself," I said.
"I know I would."
"You paid for this trip, didn't you, Jay?"
He got up and leaned against the window frame.
"Not some big corporation after this One-Sixty-Fiver cartel," I went on.
I looked at him.
"You got Dr. Stvan and me together. You facilitated everything. You set all of it up and paid for it," I
said as I became more convinced and my incredulity grew. "You could do that because you're very rich.
Because your family's very rich: That's why you went into law enforcement, isn't it. To get away from
being rich. And then you act rich, look rich, anyway."
For an instant, he was caught.
"You don't like it when you're not the one doing the interrogating, do you?" I said.
"It's true I didn't want to be like my father. Princeton, crewing, marrying into the proper family, kids all
proper, everything proper."
We were side by side now, looking down at the street as if something interesting was going on in the
world outside our window.
