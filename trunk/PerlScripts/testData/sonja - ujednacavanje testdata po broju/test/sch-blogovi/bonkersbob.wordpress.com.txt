Not sure what is going to come on this blog, I’m especially interested in the Jungian perspective of psychosis. Jung became a sort of understudy to Freud but separated in that Freud was focused on the  sexual whereas Jung was focused on the spiritual.

I’m also interested in John Weir Perry who was a Jungian depth  psychologist who set up a treatment center where no psychiatric drugs were used and by the sound of things they had some success.

I’m not anti psychiatric drugs though, I’ve been on several including olanzpine, seroquel and risperidal consta for the last 6 years, I’ve gained a lot of weight since going on the drugs but I’m not sure if the drugs are the main reason, depression is probably a bigger factor along with my penchant for fish and chips, donner kebabs and lager.


I’ve just finished reading a book by a fellow Mancunian and schizophrenia sufferer Anthony Scally. ‘Eyebrows and other fish’ is a personal account of the authors experience of schizophrenia.

Anthony’s wicked sense of humor shines through and it had me in stitches in places, one very funny moment is when Anthony is reading a lot of secret meaning into car number pates, advertising and colours and he believes that there is a powerful secret society who make these coded messages. He phones up the head office of Jacob’s biscuits who made a chocolate biscuit and had a catchy theme song which went ‘if you like a lot of chocolate biscuit on your biscuit, join of club!’, he enquires about about joining their club in all seriousness to much amusement of his co-worker who thinks he’s making an hilarious dead pan a wind up call. There are also some challenging parts of the book, which include abuse suffered whist in care, Anthony doesn’t hold anything back.

Its one of the few books that I’ve been really into for ages, I can relate to all of his experiences of paranoia surrounding secret societies and hidden symbolism and it stired up a few memories, but in a safe way due to Anthony now having excellent insight into his illness, if anything the book should help newly diagnosed people come to terms with the fact that they have an illness, especially when its written by such a funny and likeable character.



I am still getting a risperidal shot in the bum every fortnight and I’ve got a months supply of chlorpromazine to take prn when needed along with zopiclone sleeping tablets, which my friend affectionately calls Zonkaloids, I’m taking 7.5mg pills so you could say I’m on seven point five Zonks on the zonker scale. I was prescibed some pills for stress and  anxiety recently (Valium) which were superduper, but they will give me any more, think they prefer to keep the best ones for themselves.
