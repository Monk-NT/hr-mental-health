Well, it's been hellish, the past few days. I'm pulling through. Feel hurt and disappointed. Booked to go away on a short holiday to see old friends. Hopefully my social worker can do something on my behalf while I'm away to smooth things out with the folk over at the community. It's been a very clear example of the them-and-us kind of an attitude that pervades the whole mental healthcare system. Not that that is necessarily bad - it just makes for more difficulties when things go wrong. Friends suddenly change into members of the organisation and there's the whole issue of a united front to deal with. Me? I just keep listening to my Ian White tapes and try to pick my way through all the nonsense.


Not much to say - I'm getting ill. All the recent nonsense is piling up and I can feel the repressed emotion and twisted thinking doing its damage. Not nice. I've booked to take a short break next week. Go and sit by the sea and let out some of the nastiness. I don't know. It's a mess.

Thanks for your interest. I'll get back in touch soon.


Oh well, another painful week, I'm afraid. But I see that I've got some more comments so that ought to cheer me up.

I tell you, it's a mind-field out there - it's so easy to do the wrong thing and cause an upset. You know what I've discovered is that not everybody who works in mental healthcare is necessarily very sane themselves. Mostly it's O.K. But when the pressure is really on then it can be surprising the way some people jump. I'm not wanting to lay blame exactly; it's more of an observation. I suppose that when it comes to it we're ALL in the same boat. Personally, I'm finding my feet in the christian faith and that really does produce some startling results. E.g. Love your enemies. Wow! That's enormous. Anyway, I've been up to my neck in it again. That crazy joke-that-went-wrong has terminated a two-year long attempt to get myself sorted with a viable alternative to hospital treatment. I was all set up for a summer out in the country planting vegetables and eating of the harvest. Bad news. I annoyed the hierarchy I think. They got shot of me like in some Greek tragedy. My friends (such as I have) have been consoling. I'm obviously out looking for sympathy. But there is a serious moral to it all: when somebody who has gone so far as to declare a psychiatric disorder makes a mess of things then it behoves those in positions of authority to behave impecably towards said person for fear of causing further trouble. What I mean is that difficult situations need to be handled with care. Care needs to be taken. For normal everyday folk, a bad day is just that - a bad DAY. But for those of us with a disturbed recent past, a bad day can set off a whole load of stuff, albeit unintentionally, and I think that it's very important that people be given the benefit of the doubt as much as possible. After all, in workplace or school situations there is usually a procedure for dealing with problems that arise, often involving verbal warnings and the like. Well, we're human beings too you know. We deserve an equal chance at justice as well as the any other.

Ah, you can tell that I'm pretty down about it all. Headache, heartache; a sorry tale. How you doin'? Get back to you later. 'Bye for now, Alan.

Yeah, so I feel hard done by. Bitter and twisted. The place I was going has dumped me. I'm gutted. So far, the only good thing is that I haven't gone psychotic over it. It's just this sort of emotional trauma that sends me off on one. Other than that, it's all a bit of a mess. Like being in a combat zone. We'll see where I get to. Probably I should count my blessings. That's what a psychologist would say. The truth is that I think I've been had: or that I've missed an opportunity to remedy the situation. I was too diplomatic, wasn't I? Not wanting to offend when really I'm furious. But, you see, mad people aren't allowed to actually get mad. It's taken as a sign of illness. Oh, I'm just making excuses maybe. All the best to you. You know who you are...

G'night.


Hello again. I'm having my sunday night siesta. Just lounging around. There's a lot of lounging-around-therapy involved in my treatment plan. In some ways, just being happy with my own company is a real breakthrough considering what it's been like when things are the opposite to comfortable. If any of you have had the experience of going to visit somebody on a ward and have thought what a dreadful, dull, lifeless kind of environment it can be then it's worth making the effort to understand that it's not the medication or the regieme particlarly; it's what's required after all the shocks and distubances of a traumatic time. Nothing much happens, and that's a welcome break. As things settle down and the patient's condition improves (which can take months and months) then there ought to be some way of re-engaging in "occupational" activity. I ended up working in the gardens myself. Anyway, it's not all as doom and gloomy as it often first seems to appear.

Hope all's well with you all. Speak soon,


It's Eastertime and it makes me think of how lucky we are to get away with making so many mistakes, for doing so many things wrong. I was really a gonner when those two police put me in the back of the van to be carted off to a place of safety. I did my best to get out of it: advocacy, sheriff court, climbing out the window. But really, it was the right solution to the difficulties I'd got myself into. Life had overwhelmed me and I needed to be saved. It's a hard thing sometimes to accept when we need help. I'm getting better at it as time goes on. I was way out of line and now I'm more part of the community. A long bumpy road to be sure. But when all is said and done where would I be now if I hadn't been taken in for reprogramming? (!). No, really, it has been an experience. Eye-openingly so. When I think of all the people, all over the world, who are giving or undergoing treatment. It's a colossal undertaking. Three cheers for all the good guys. And hip, hip, hooray for my fellow patients. Hopefully, we're all going the right way. Happy Easter.

I think I'll have a night off. Actually, I typed in a whole spiel but it got lost on the way to the server. Too bad. Anyway, I'm listening to "Folk, Roots and Acoustic" on Radio 2. Salsa Celtica!. Cool. It's a crazy mixed-up world we live in, don't you think so? See you. Alan.

Actually, I'll write a bit: it's late and I've just been on the phone discussing the relative merits of Asperger's and schizophrenia. I know that they're both nasty, horrible things. It's a scary business altogether. So much so that I've developed a very dry, rather cheeky humour as a counter to the harsh reality of illness. Anyway, it's not so important what gets called what. The important thing is to move towards good health. And really if something like a diagnosis helps then it can be used to achieve the aim of recovery. I have to say that it's taken a few years for me to come round to that particular point of view. And I did try to shake off the whole notion of being ill at first. Like most folk, I think I learn from experience. And I've had a lot of helping hands along the way. And it ain't over yet....

"Illness" or "condition"? It's the same kind of choice - whatever helps the case along; whatever the patient feels comfortable with (at least, up to a point. I well remember the first time I saw "psychotic" written on a piece of paper with my name at the top of it. Man, I nearly jumped out of my skin! But, you know, it was correct). Like I say, it's a funny old game this psychiatry....

Ah well, have a good night. Sleep well.

P.S. Blimey! I've just been reading one of the other blogs and it is scary stuff. I'm considerably chastened. It's all to easy to forget what an excrutiating trial it is for other folk when somebody goes over the edge. Trying to look after a psychotic person must be unendurable at times. Then again it's no joy ride being there in the middle of it all either. What a world we live in.
