I just realized what has been tricking me into thinking that my thoughts are being projected-

I have a rapid thought coupled with a quick burst of emotion.

But it is really just going on within myself.

I am brilliantly crafted. A strange creature. A gifted machine.

I understand that I am flesh and blood. I feel it. I feel my mortality!

It is a wondrous and frightful thing to sense your being...King David was right!

It is good to not make assumptions about people- such as body language or voice tone, or make assumption about circumstances, because when you don't, you save yourself from a lot of negative emotions and beliefs. But if you do have to believe something, teach yourself to make the assumption in a positive manner.

After completely screwing up and ruining a relationship, I spent a day painting and thinking about who it is exactly that I want to be, and what I should do to get there. Leaving out the messy details, I compiled a collection of values:

1. Shift thoughts, No ruminating, Take thoughts captive to the obedience of Christ.
2. Learn to cope with feelings alone. Observe and Describe emotion. Is the emotion a result of a problem that can be effectively fixed? Or is it irrational?
3. Be disciplined. Always do your best. Set up a realistic routine.
4. Be responsible. Be wise in making choices.
5. Cultivate healthy relationships.
6. Stay true to your faith.

Whatever is going on in your mind you attract. Anytime your thoughts are flowing, the law of attraction is working. Pay attention to what you are attracted to. Use your feelings to direct what kind of experiences you want. Buddha said, "Our present is the result of the past. All we are is the result of what we have thought." Focusing on disease only creates more disease. So if your schizophrenic, depressed, etc, if you think only about your uncomfortable experiences, and your dwelling on them, your mind, which creates your reality, will create more of it. Learn to become still, and pay attention to what you wish to experience. All power is from within, and therefore under our control. Whether you think you can, or you can't, either way you are right.
Declare what you would like to have in life, and then take action. Do not focus on what you already are, but what you would like to be. See yourself in the end result.

How does one test their beliefs when you speak in your mind and a voice replies back? By not believing IN the voice. It is not a person. It is not a spirit. It is not a devil. It is a hallucination. It is real in the sense that it is happening, but the connection that it is something outside of yourself is not true.

When you encounter a weakness, you defeat it by creating a strength to counterbalance it. 

Since changing my medication from Seroquel to Abilify, the voices and intrusive thoughts have increased. Listening to music isn't enough anymore. I can't let my imagination wander, because whatever I'm focusing on I hallucinate over. So I have found a new strategy to focus without concentrating so hard:

I am actively reading, writing, learning, and memorizing. The four are intertwined. Sometimes just one isn't enough, so I shift back and forth from the four. Right now I'm studying Psychology and the Bible. It keeps me from being bored and it keeps intrusive thoughts at bay. Because I'm concentrating on what I'm learning and not thinking about people, I'm hardly hallucinating.

My mind is finally calm. There was some sort of connection to the problems I was having... and that has lead me to finally conclude that I am some sort of a sensitive spiritual being. To be honest, I have always known this- I just have been in denial because of the huge amount of negative energy in the world. There is enough negativity to wound your heart, as it has me and the trauma that I deal with. Today I have begun using my speech to use power to bring out positive energy. There is lots of good around you in the midst of desparation if you look for it.

oday is turning out to be a very hard day. I have been relapsing since a couple days ago. The voices are constant, and it is wearing me out. Suicide is not foreign to my mind. I just want some relief! I'm so tired of always concentrating so hard trying to control my thoughts. I've fallen back into rumination, and it's hard to get out.

I have been listening to music constantly... I'm going to go deaf... I have to turn it up really loud.

I really wanted to go on my walk today but I couldn't because my mind is racing around too much... it's such a shame... I'm locked up in the house.

DAMNIT I'M GOING CRAZY!

I felt the presence of God in the morning. It was so sweet. I literally smiled myself awake. Then, as I was making coffee, He told me to read the Scritpures. I read until He had spoken to me, and his message was this: Even those who reject Jesus, God still has compassion for, and he will always tell them the truth.

 have learned that you must use multiple coping skills in order to get through symptoms. Why multiple? Well, sometimes a certain coping skill may work great- and other times it may not work at all. You need to prepare a backup plan of how you're going to cope when you're having symptoms. I'll give an example:

Tonight I was hearing voices and was also having an anxiety attack at the same time. The first thing I did was put on my headphones that are connected to my MP3 player to drown out the voices. I didn't feel safe in my room so I went into the living room and sat down on the couch. Then I prayed to Jesus, that he would pull me through this experience. After that, I told myself a couple of times that I was ok and perfectly safe. Then, to lower the anxiety, I breathed deeply. When my heart had calmed down a little I asked myself what wisdom I could use at this moment, and I came up with a law of nature- it is a natural law for people to be unable to read minds. Finally, when the anxiety was just about gone, I comforted myself- speaking to myself gently and with compassion. And then I was fine. :)

So, my advice out there is that if you're mentally ill you need to learn as many coping skills as you can!
