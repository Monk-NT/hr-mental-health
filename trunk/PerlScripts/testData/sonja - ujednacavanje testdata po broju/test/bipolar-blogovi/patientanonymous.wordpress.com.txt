Why do we have such a problem with this? Why can some of us never do this? If we’re such stigma busters, why do we find it so easy doing it for others, but not for ourselves?

All we may end up doing is busting our own teeth to bits of dental shrapnel with steel jaws of silence.  Busting our own stomachs into holes with repeated uppercuts of pain we feel we deserve.  Busting our own hearts to shreds with guilt, shame and denial.

I don’t want to belabour the beatings I’ve been giving myself lately.  However, I don’t think I can be too successful, there.  I need them to serve as examples.  At least to a degree?

When I write all of those things, to a lot of people (to a lot of you!) I’m sure it can seem very tiring.  Also, annoying, pitiful and like never ending cries for help.  Probably like a lot of attention seeking behaviour, too.  Even this post may sound a lot like that!

When I write in that manner, it is a cry for help! Though, of a different sort? I want to help myself but I don’t know how.  It is also “attention seeking behaviour.”  Though, in a different way, as well? Something inside me desperately needs attention.

Just like trying to help myself, I get so lost and don’t know how to find whatever it is that needs attention.  Then I think, even if I could find it, would I know how to attend to it? What attention to give it? Maybe I sometimes do manage to figure it out, but I’m still too lost to know what to do about it.  Does anyone else feel the same?

I definitely welcome any “help” or “attention” from others.  Perhaps if people still struggle with those words and the phrases that surround them above, better words could be: support, recognition, empathy, validation.  I’m not sure.  Playing Jeopardy with the semantics of psychology is a game that could last a person’s entire life.

Coping mechanisms, strategies, reinforcement of all types of things one can learn to deal with their issues are all good.  Still, they are very hard to put into practice—and keep practising.  Not that they should be thrown out the window altogether, but I feel “learning” tends to have a very slim chance vs. “unlearning” a lot of the time.  Again, does anyone else feel the same?

Either way, for all of us who stigmatize ourselves, we’ve got to somehow get this mental (un)health albatross free from our necks before it chokes us to death.  I wish I could offer a solution but I’m still looking.


I’ve just arrived back at hospital, tossed my stuff in my room and tossed the meds they gave me back at one of the nurses.  I’m going to go isolate myself in my room for the rest of the evening and ponder a few things.  One of which is the option of being discharged tomorrow.  I really don’t know if there is much of a point in me staying here until Tuesday.  Why?

The decision was made last Wednesday by everyone (myself included) that I had been given all the assistance possible from this stay.  It is extremely unfortunate that I ended up shooting through the stratosphere of Ultradian Cycling over the weekend, but it could not be helped.  It is also extremely unfortunate that I am Ultradian Cycler who cannot tell she is cycling until she is smack dab in the middle of it.  That cannot be helped either.

Trust me.  I wish to hell I did not have Bipolar at all.  I wish to hell I didn’t end up leaving such a trail of destruction in my wake when I cycle.  I wish to hell all of that destruction didn’t end up hurting so many people including me.  However, I cannot help having Bipolar, either.

As I just explained in an email to someone who was not quite sure how all of this worked, I said it was like “The train’s left the station!” It is all I can do to just hang on for the ride.  Once it starts, I have no control.  That is not some pathetic and weak excuse for my behaviour.  It is, quite simply, the extremely unfortunate nature of Bipolar.

Sometimes you may know what the trigger/s are, sometimes you haven’t the faintest idea.  But even if you do, once the train is speeding down those tracks, you can still only hang on.  And while doing so, it is also extremely unfortunate that you temporarily lose your vision.  You only regain it once the train finally stops.  Then, with sight returned that makes you want to rip your own eyeballs out of your skull, an extremely unfortunate clarity is given back.

You wish with every fibre of your being you could turn back time, erase it all, but it’s just not possible.  You apologize a million times to everyone (but never to yourself) and after a lifetime of doing it, you just want to give up.  You believe you’re trapped forever, no one cares or will ever forgive you again.  And that’s extremely unfortunate, too.

I am so fucked up it’s gotten to the point of epic embarrassment.  I’m serious.  Hey, at least I’ll admit it? Christ, I admitted I was an alcoholic on Twitter last night! Points for that, too? Although, after so many years, self-restraint if I drink at all.  Near Beer is a good thing if I feel like a taste.

I’m not afraid to be honest.  Well, being honest does scare me at times but I’ll still do it.  Lies don’t get you anywhere in the end.

Not that I’ve told a “lie” here.  This is the truth and more of a confession, really.  I don’t know if anyone has noticed, and no one has contacted me since, but it’s not like I’m such an epic figure online.  However, I certainly did act like huge, fucked up, epic ass last night.  So, if any of you did notice, this is why.

As far as that Tweet about me stating I’m an alcoholic (or anything else you’d like to read) they’re all gone except for anything dated prior to the end of October.  That action lends itself to the above title.  In my deletion madness, I even accidentally unfollowed a follower, then had to re-follow them! They may have noticed as they probably got an email to say I was following them (again.) You see? Fucked up epic embarrassment!

That’s not all I did, though! I decided to make my blog private! Everyone knows I NEVER do this unless there is a very serious reason for it.  Such as, the safety of readers, to deal with trolls or other people trying to cause a ruckus, but not for me to pull some asinine shit like last night! There is no “reason” to keep people from reading my blog other than the above.  There is no “sensitive” material on it as far as me!

No.  The only thing I wanted to achieve last night, is that I wanted to vanish.  Completely.  From everyone.  In the entire world.  And I don’t mean killing myself. *shakes head*  I’m not suicidal.  However, I had to fight off doing a cutting with all of my strength last night.  That was pretty rough.

So, this whole weekend pass deal hasn’t exactly turned out quite as nicely as I thought.  What I had thought (or planned) to do were the obvious practical things.  Tidying up, see what condition the place was in after not being around for so long.  I also had some small and simple ideas of things to do that would hopefully make me happy.  Things that I had continued before I left, or things that I wanted to start before I went to hospital.  Nope.

Instead, I ended up sleep deprived because my schedule went completely off.  Along with the crazy sleep, nightmares (one that I could interpret within about 45 seconds after having it.)

Two damn near panic attacks but fighting off taking my Valium because the nurses are starting to drill it into my head that I’m developing a dependency–plus I already get stubborn in that area as it is.  I play the game: “I’m strong enough.  I can get through this.  I don’t need it.” That’s just a mindset from how I was raised.  I keep doing it as stupid as it is, and then keep paying the consequences for being as stupid as I am.  The anxiety gets too out of control and then I’m royally screwed.

Still, to have anxiety so high to reach a degree of such panicky levels! Further, I don’t know if it was two, or one massive, panicky freak out with a bit of a break in between.  Also, beyond that, my moods were all over the map.  Depressed, frustrated, feeling like I was just going to implode.  Last night, I curled up on my bed and bawled for about an hour until 0200hrs.  I was adamant about not going to sleep! I even had a couple of cigarettes inside my flat! Out.Of.My.Mind.

A bit of the Bipolar, perhaps? At least the Ultradian Cycling keeps it short, but bloody hell! Pretty bad go around this time? I haven’t cycled in ages if memory serves.  Not since the summer, maybe?

This weekend pass.  I kept thinking yesterday, ‘Things will be better tomorrow.’ But here it is “tomorrow” and I have to head straight back to hospital.  And just for two days!

I was questioning all along the point of this weekend pass ever since it was suggested two weeks ago.  I was questioning it even more so last week, as I’m being discharged on Tuesday.  Then, should such a disaster have happened like this, I could have dealt with it in a better fashion.  I’m quite sure things wouldn’t have gotten this far.  I would have had suitable time to handle things properly and I wouldn’t have gone so over the top.

I don’t even want to be bothered to go back to hospital now that I’m here.  No choice, with that.  AWOL!!! The police would come and bust down my door.  I’d be dragged out of here so fast I wouldn’t be able to attempt to say I’m fine.

Anyway, if any of you did notice, I’m fine.  All things considered.  Relatively.  Kind of.  You know.  Yeah.  Plus, I’m still completely embarrassed for being a total, epic fucktard.  Which then resulted in me really going off my nut in the worst way possible in the online world to date.
