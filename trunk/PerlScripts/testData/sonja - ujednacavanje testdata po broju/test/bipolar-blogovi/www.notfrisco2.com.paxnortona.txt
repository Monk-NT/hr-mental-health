I’m watching a video/trying to get information off a web site about a national monument known for an Indian who was tied to a threshing floor and forced to push it. The Indian looks dark and old, but still strong from the years of toil. The excruciating question is “Is he still there?” and not “Is he even still alive?” but “Have they released him?” The lighting is very much like one of the late night video stills I take with my webcam. A shudder turns me over in my sleep and I want the dream to end.

Someone saw my meme about my invisible illness and took offense with my answer to #15 which was “The hardest thing to accept about my new reality has been: That it is going to be like this all the way to the end.”. He felt compelled to tell me that I should not feel that I had to take meds, that I should learn from his example and not allow myself to be “contained”.

I plan to ignore the advice, though I feel a reply is warranted which is that I spent many years avoiding using psychotropics to curb my mood swings, possibly more years than my critic has been alive. In the end, I decided to go with them because I saw the ruin that my unbridled manias, depressions, and mixed states wreaked upon my family. I chose safety out of a conviction whose basis lies in strength of character.

Having said that, I must comment on the threat that I represent to some of the unmedicated. I have made the choice to take medications. It’s a free act. While I have told people that the pharmaceuticals have helped me, I also acknowledge the freedom not to take them. So why was this guy so threatened by me?

I have met a wide range of people who choose not to take medication. Many are depressives who choose to ride out their pain as a matter of character. I have great respect for these, though I have to wonder why one would choose pain over relief. It’s ultimately not mine to make.

Then there are those who just can’t give up their alcohol, their pot, their slim figures that come without attention to diet or exercise. I find these a problematic and ultimately vain. But it is still their choice.

Then there are those who have been hurt by overmedication or mismedication. I have more sympathy for these because they have been forced to suffer involuntarily. Still, I know also of those who have been put through the psychiatric wringer who, nonetheless, kept searching for a decent doctor who listened to them and prescribed with a mind to preserving the personality. It doesn’t need to be “stand up and don’t take your medications versus cower and do.” It’s more important to get the facts, measure the sacrifices, and choose intelligently versus emotionally.

I value emotions. I value the love I have for my wife and pets. I value the way my mind reveals the world to me. These emotions informed my decision to build dikes around my harbor so that I would not flood those around me with extremes. Yes, I like moderate amounts of safety alongside adventure. I wouldn’t climb cliffs without a rope. I wouldn’t put the pedal to the metal and go down El Toro at 100 mph. And I won’t terrify my wife with scenes where I talk about agents of the government following me and people on the net coming to destroy everything I have come to love. I won’t permit myself to be narrowly pigeonholed as a dupe of the psychiatric establishment. Yea, I prefer to within the sense of relative safety that the dispersal of my paranoia by medications afford. Admitting that ugly things happen when I don’t take themmakes me no coward but courageous in matters of my self.

The sun kept shining into my eye as I drove down El Toro Road en route to my meeting last night. I lowered the visor to protect my eyes, but the twistiness of the boulevard kept moving the position of the day star relative to my eyes and I had to shrink and bend my body to avoid its flare.

For no especial reason — no one walked across the street bearing a sign saying “Wake up!” — a realization swerved to meet me. I had been avoiding any serious thought or creative impulse because I was afraid of triggering a relapse of my condition. Was this really necessary?

I’ve starved my mind and as a consequence, it has craved thought of any kind, even the misadventures of bad memories. If I leave it empty, it will attempt to relieve the tedium by filling the desert with images of cruel encounters from my past. What if I let myself think? What if I relied on my meds to keep me from jumping into episodes and on my wife to tell me when I was losing control? What if I enjoyed the road again instead of driving below the speed limit all the time?

I have a disease. But it doesn’t mean I must opt out of life.

ot two minutes ago, a liberal tweeter said three words to me: “Michelle Bachmann #psycho”. This is pretty typical fare from certain members of the Twitter Left (and the Twitter Right for their part). When poorly educated, shallow Republican tools speak up, their words are denounced as coming from the mentally ill.

Let me get something clear. I am a progressive. I was a progressive before I went on meds and I am a progressive now. Part of my political ideology impels me to live a life as free of prejudice as possible. Supposedly the woman who vomited this hairball believes in the same principle. I doubt she would attack Michael Steele’s blackness or call Senator Graham a fag. But she doesn’t live it when it comes to the mentally ill. Where we are concerned, the rules change. You can abuse the mentally ill all you want through the indirect means of equating psychiatric diagnoses with the follies of your enemies.

Bray ends her article by observing that the three parties in Great Britain have signed a compact agreeing to avoid stigmatizing language in their political debates, campaigns, and other public utterances. When I hear even liberals whine when they are called to task for the abuse of psychiatric terminology, I think it essential that we begin to civilize our language so that people are not made to hate themselves for accidents of genetics.

Stop saying that Michelle Bachmann is insane. She’s not anything like me.
