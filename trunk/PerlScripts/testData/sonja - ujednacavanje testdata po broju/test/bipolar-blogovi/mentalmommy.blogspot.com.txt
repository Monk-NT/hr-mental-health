As a child I was fortunate enough to never experience death around me. I lost my grandpa when I was six, but he was far away - I wasn't there to watch him die. I lost the odd pet, but people seem to move on from hamsters, birds, fish and rabbits. The past three years, there seems to have been a death. I have come to realize that death itself is not an ugly things. What makes death ugly is the personalities that it brings out in those around the individual who is dying. Suddenly, as the death nears...people start to look at ways to hold onto memories and the dreaded reading of the will. The death of the individual become a battle ground as people fight for what they rightfully believe is theirs or is at the very least what they believed is owed to them.



When a parent is dying - who should come first the current wife or the son? Is there an answer? Both hold a special place in the persons heart. The problem is that when you are looking at land that has been in the family for years (early 1900s), it holds not only sentimental value, but also monetary value. One individual wants to sell it (to pay off debts and continue to be provided for and one wants to preserve it for future generations). Neither is truly in the wrong. From an outsider a fair compromise would be to subdivide the land - both parties win. The problem now becoming one of pride...a decision was made and the conflicting attitudes has put the poor dying individual's back up against the wall. I wouldn't want to be in his position at all.



I of course agree with the son. The land should stay in the family. I know what it means to him and his boys. I've seen how alive and comfortable he is when he's there. While I enjoy going there and I enjoy the memories, I am certainly not as connected at they are. While I would hate to see it being sold and I think it is being done rather underhandedly, is it truly our decision to make. Hence my question of where do the loyalties lie?



Facts (as I've been told):


The land was original willed to the son when he was a child. Due to fear of the will be contested the will was changed leaving it to the son's father. Some say it was done so with the understanding that it would one day belong to the son. True? No one knows unless they were there and privy to the conversation.

When the father divorced his first wife, she didn't fight for the farm believing that it would one day go to their youngest son.

The sister offered to buy the land about five years ago, when there was talk of it being sold. She approached her father and was told that he decided not to sell because he was going to one day leave it to his son.

The son, approached his father stating that he hopes to get the land once he passes. He would hate to see it leave the family and worries about what would happen if it was left to the current wife. He is told that the land will be sold and that it had always been the plan. Talk about slap in the face - total surprise to my husband, who always believed the farm to one day be his. He is suddenly questioning how much his father truly cared for him - thinking about what the farm meant to both of them. Why suddenly the change of heart?


Of course word gets out and the fight begins. Even I play my part. I thought it was VERY important for the father to know what his son was feeling. So, I wrote a letter. I express myself better in writing. I mentioned the original will, the feelings and memories the farm hold and of course how much it was impacting his son - something that the son could never express on his on. He's struggling so much and trying hard not to see his dad in this new light. Instead he is projecting it onto the current wife - not fair either. I also mentioned that it seemed unfair of them to ask the son to help hang new curtains and move things around to make room for new furniture, when they are supposedly in so much debt that they need to sell the land for the wife to survive upon his passes...not to mention the work they expecting him to do around the farm. Of course he wants to help keep it up for them, so they can sell it quickly and get the most money - NOT. I knew full well there would be consequences to my actions, but what shocked me was the lines that were pulled out:



Who was I to deprive a dying man of a new chair to keep himself comfortable - if he cares more about a chair than his son's feelings, his priorities are way off.

The son was told that the land would be sold years ago and said he didn't care what happens to it - um not. Plus, things tend to change over the years even if that was the case.

I am in it for the money and that all I ever think about is myself...true I often think about myself before others, I've never denied that; however, in the case I am looking out for the son, the father and the wife. The selling of the land means the end of any contact once the father passes and I won't be able to do much to change that. If it was about the money, I wouldn't be trying to preserve the land for the son and his boys. I guess according to her it has always only been about the money to me - apparently she's forgotten about my parents and the type of lifestyle that I grew up in...I assure you I didn't need to marry for money. If it was about the money I would want all the land and not just a small section.

To me, so much precious time is being wasted fighting over this land...time that could be spend create more memories and not friction. If the letter hit home that hardly, then you know there is truth to at least some of what I wrote. While what happens to the land is out of our hands at this point...I needed for them to know the consequences it is and would have on the relationships. I needed to plant the seed of compromising. Why not create a win-win? Me, personally...sell the land. Yes I saw years more memories being created there and perhaps the opportunity to live there one day when they boys have moved out...but it doesn't hold the same value to me as it does the son and so many others in that family. Just as she will continue to defend her actions and those of the father, who by the way will only talk to his son about selling the farm when she is in the room - Stalemate: no one can move without someone being put in harms way.

Wow, what a show it was on Dr. Phil today: Mental Illness and Motherhood I sat and watched it in complete bewilderment. How dare Shelly steal Amy and Scott Kehoe's twins. Who is she to decide whether they are fit parents? I think it is absolutely absurd to base someone’s abilities to mother a child solely on their mental status. It is discrimination and purely indicative of society’s view toward Mental Illness.

At the end of the show though, it was apparent that it is not actually about Amy's ability to be a mother, it is about Shelley's inability to let the twins go. Dr. Phil offered to help provide neutral parties to review all the living situations, background information and health information, but even then Shelly refused. Shelly, you are the unfit mother. What message is it that you are sending to your children? You are willing to judge others based on health issues and past mistakes. You are willing to walk around with blinders on and judge people. Who gave you that power? I have two children. I understand the connection that is made during the nine months of pregnancy, the bond that forges. I can't even imagine saying goodbye to the babies after that; however, Shelly went into the pregnancy knowing then end result and after having done it before. The difference this time, she may never see the babies again. The last two times she'd agreed to carry babies was for a friend; I'm guessing a friend who is still in her life.

I worry more about the children. I wonder what kind of impact this will have on their growth. There is currently publicity behind the issue. I have no doubt that this will emerge as when the children are older. I can't even imagine the confusion and pain it will cause. I also wonder what it will be like to miss out on the biological bond that exists between a mother and a child - yes Shelly, biological. You are no more than an incubator. I was appault when you you said "what a hoot" at one point when someone pointed out that the twins aren't biologically yours - this isn't a game. These are people's lives that you're playing with. Over and over you mentioned that they weren't puppies or kittens...but you neglect to mention that they are children. They have bonded with your family, very true, but what about their family. Children are extremely reseleant. They are young enough that they will adapt and have no problems bonding with their parents.

I worry about the future of the twins for another reason. I wonder what the surrogate parents will tell these children when their DNA is different. Are they not afraid that this (imperfection) will not be passed on to these children? Shelly, what happens if one of them, or both of them, suffer from some type of mental illness? Are you able to handle that? You have already shown your ignorance in regards to the issue and made your judgement about mental illness. How will you love and support the child?

You also neglect to look beyond Amy. Did you look at the support systems in place? Have you never been stressed or needed help?

Mental illness is beging given as the excuse, but it is not the true reason. Shelley and Paul’s decision to keep these children is in no way based on Amy’s mental state- either past or present. This was made strikingly obvious to me when she stated that there would be no way, under any circumstances, that she would return those children to their rightful parents. The issue that we should be looking at is a broken law - a law that has created a loop for legal kidnapping.

If the issue was based on Mental Illness, Shelly and Paul would allow the professionals to step in. They would give Amy and Scott a chance to raise the children. We don't know what tomorrow holds, but we sometimes have to take a leap of faith today. Amy has a difficult past - with criminal activities, but the key is the past. Any individual healthy, unhealthy, stable or unstable can take a wrong turn. Who are we to judge that?

I've said it before and I'll say it again, In life we must
"allow ourselves the mistakes we know we'll make and forgive ourselves for those we think we won't."

Mental Ilnness should not be a reason to stop someone from being a loving parent. My children have learnt empathy and emotion understanding beyond their years. They will tell you that I am I wonderful mother. I spend more time with my boys than many other parents I know. If anything, I overcompensate and "love" too much. For every down period, I have more up time. The key in our house, is the strong support system and the continual education around my health and the open communication.

I don't know who is right or wrong here. I am in no more of a position to make judgment than the next person. I can sit here and say what I would do, but I'm not Shelly. However, having grown up without my biological parents (in a very loving home), suffering from mental illness and being a parent, I ask that Shelly find it in her heart to give the twins back to Amy and Scott. Shelly, you have to know that what you are doing is hurting everyone in the long run.
