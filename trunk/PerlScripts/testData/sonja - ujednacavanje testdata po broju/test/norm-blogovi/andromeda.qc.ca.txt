So apparently this year I’m sucking at the Holidailies thing. I just haven’t felt like updating. I’ve been too busy with other things during the day and then by evening I’m kind of tired and brain-dead.

On the other hand I can’t quite think of anything in particular that I did that would keep me from sitting down and typing up a quick update. Ah well.

Anyway, I haven’t dumped or edited any photos in a couple of days either so I don’t have anything pretty to share. I do have one brief story I don’t want to forget though.

On Tuesday I took Breanna up to the school with me and handled the PPO used toys sale from 8 am until 11:30. Breanna came with me last year and had fun; this year was even better. She sorted money into the cash box, I’d tell her what to give back as change, and she helped bag up purchases if someone had bought a bunch of small stuff.

The entire sale went well in general and I do love watching kids shop. It’s interesting to see what they’ll be attracted to and it’s fun to listen to them excitedly chatter over their finds.

However, there was one little boy in particular – probably grade two – who was so sweet that I just wanted to fold him up and put him in my pocket. He had bought a handful of very stereotypically boy things. He was carrying around a couple of Transformers, a Spiderman figure, and a dinosaur. He seemed pretty thrilled with his haul. He had 50 cents left and wanted to know what he could get with it. I showed him the 25 cent table and said he could get two things there or that he could get one thing from the 50 cent table next to it.

A few minutes later he hopped up to me and joyfully held up something very different from his other things. It was a little black purse, about the size that Paris Hilton uses to cart around her little dogs. On one side it had a pink silhouette of a girl and on the other side it had a pink French poodle. The entire thing was covered in sparkles.

He excitedly told me that he had picked it up at the 50 cent table and that was what he wanted. I smiled and said okay and took him two quarters. Then he grinned and bounced a little on the balls of his feet and whispered, “it’s for my mom, she likes pretty purses and this one is REALLY pretty.”

Well. I was in the throes of PMS so it took everything I had in me not to just CRY. Instead I patted him on the shoulder, told him the purse was absolutely beautiful, and sent him off to catch up to his class who had left already.

It was the sweetest thing that I saw all day and I love that a little boy would buy something like that for his mother. If it was me, I would carry that purse EVERYWHERE just because of the thought.

Sometimes my faith in the world is restored by the simplest things.

The weather was a little bi-polar up here today. This morning it was snowing and it was actually the kind of snow that I like, with the big, fat flakes that float down slowly. It was also quite warm out. We had planned our Advent activity today to be sledding but I wasn’t sure how that would work out since they were calling for at least two hours of freezing rain in the afternoon. In the end George said we should go anyway so we set it up with our friends to meet at a nearby park and after a tasty brunch (George fried up some bacon then made us egg and cheese “McMuffins”, yummy) we were suited up in our snow suits and in the van.

I’m so glad we went. When we got there it was overcast but nothing more than that and the temperatures were still holding at reasonable levels. We were there for an hour and a half and in that time we also saw some mixed precipitation (that’s a mix of snow and rain for those of you who aren’t well-versed in Canadian winters), followed by ice pellets (a little painful on the face while zipping down a hill on a saucer but bearable), then just overcast skies again. Right as we were leaving there was a light pattering of rain and then that cleared up before we even got home.

Despite the weird transitional weather we had so much fun. The ice pellets lasted all of 15 minutes so I’m glad we didn’t change our plans based on the forecast. This is the second time in a row that a forecast has been wildly wrong. Last week they said to expect about 5 centimeters of snow and we got over 30. This week they warned of a 25 centimeter storm, then changed to a bit of snow and the freezing rain, and we ended up with little to worry about. Silly meteorologists!

I love sledding and other than a few minutes of break time here and there I pretty much spent the whole time going up and down the hill. We were four adults and four kids, plus we spent some time swapping sleds with another dad and his two sons, so it was pretty much a blast. Definitely a great Advent idea!

Even though I’ve only missed one day since Holidailies started I feel like I’m so far behind on keeping up to date on stuff. I don’t want to let my advent activities slip away without remembering them so I’ll just fill you in on that.

On day 7 the activity was one that sounds strange at first: Putting shoes by the door. Although we’re not German, many years ago I “met” a lot of moms on a big forum that no longer exists, and we all picked up different things from each other. A friend of mine whose family is German told us all about Saint Nicholas Day where children lay their shoes by the door and in the morning they find some small goodies in them. Now in all honesty we were late – the day is actually the 5th but we were lucky because the elves left the kids some very nice things. They woke up in the morning to find hair accessories, notebooks (a hot commodity around here!), and of course a bit of candy.

Day 8 was one of those days where I was trying very hard to embrace winter since we have a lot of it left, so I planned for our activity to be good for a little post-sledding. That was fun and went well. When we came in, the advent revealed that we would have big steaming mugs of hot chocolate with lots of marshmallows.

Day 9 kind of slipped by quickly so I made the activity a quiet one, reading some Christmas books in bed which was nice. Alas, I have no pictures since I was busy reading.

Today was day 10 and I decided it was a good time for something very straightforward and simple. On the one hand it’s Friday so we can hopefully sleep in at least a little bit tomorrow but on the other hand it’s also the end of the week and we were all tired. I ended up choosing to put on a Christmas special in the evening and we all watched it before getting the kids to bed. I tossed in one of my favorites, the Charlie Brown Christmas Special and it never loses its charm.

We should have some good advent stuff this weekend if everything goes well.

I ended up enjoying myself so much as I watched Winnie run free at the park that I did it again yesterday and today. I made sure to bring my cameras with me and I got some pictures and video. I was pretty nervous doing it all by myself but she did great. The fact that I brought cheese encouraged her to come back when I called too.

Today was even better. We were alone again and running, playing, and throwing sticks when all of a sudden I saw her dog friend from the other day coming out of the woods. Winnie didn’t notice at first since I was busy holding a stick but when she turned and saw the Mastiff her body tensed up in that “oh my GOD!” kind of joyful way, then she pretty much hurled herself across the park; I’m not entirely convinced that her feet touched the ground.

Even though Ginger the Mastiff was already tired from a long walk in the woods with her owner, they both played for awhile and spent some time lazing about in the snow.

It’s been fabulous seeing how easy it is to wear her out with just a nice walk, a wild romp, a lot of snow, and a walk back home. Between that and the fact that it’s almost 11 pm and Winnie’s not a night owl, she’s passed out directly behind my chair and I think she might actually be snoring.

Which is my cue to go chill out a bit and then think about bed!
