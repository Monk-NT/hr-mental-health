Although in the summertime I tend to bypass the dessert aisle, in the colder months I find myself craving pie, and pumpkin pie is my favorite indulgence.  

One afternoon, while in the supermarket shopping for a pumpkin pie, I spied the packaged coconut custard and blueberry crumb pies and decided to plunk both of these pies into my cart instead.  But - why was I so quick to pass up a pumpkin pie for these more attractive looking treats? Was a pie flat-leaver, cheating on my favorite type of pie with…another pie?

Instantly, I formulated a bizarre analysis:  Back in high school - if pies were people - would pumpkin pie be considered a wallflower?  If that were true, surely chocolate and banana cream pies were the cheerleaders. Oh, those cheerleaders – popular girls with perfect figures and wonderful lives who dated  football players and wore their jackets. (Even in a bakery window these pies are a standout.) 


And who didn’t know a girl gorgeous enough to be considered lemon meringue, full of delicious fluff and devoid of any substance?

Of course I was compelled to categorize the rest of the pies.  

I reasoned the apple, peach, and blueberry crumb pies were the outgoing, let's-all-put-on-a-play type of girls.   And while their features were less than perfect, a crumb topping made them a bit more interesting than a plain apple pie with an over-thick crust. (We all knew an apple pie in high school, didn’t we? A moon-faced girl, who would die before showing even a hint of cleavage.)

My eyes settled on a packaged mincemeat pie.  Dark in color.  Strange looking.  Off the beaten path.  That's your long-haired rocker, or gum-cracking disco freak, not into school at all.

What about coconut custard or key lime?  Certainly different, no follower there.  An artist, for sure.  Or a journalist.   

Cherry or peach pie with that alluring a peek-a-boo lattice crust? What do you think that says about a girl? 

Was my thinking skewed, or was high school a pivotal social barometer?  At the time, I certainly didn’t think so.  Then, I was a “blueberry crumb,” joining this club or that, until I gravitated to a “minecement,” kind of crowd, spending my nights at the disco clubs instead of studying at the local library.   And I'd have to say - though filled with spice and definitely worth getting to know - the "pumpkin pies" in high school were girls that no one paid much attention to at all.  

Without warning, I bumped into another woman's shopping cart with my own.  I had to know whether she viewed the bakery aisle as a typical day in the high school gym.  "What kind of pie were you in high school?”  I blurted out.  She reached into her cart, grabbed a gallon of milk, and ran in the other direction.  And so before I headed into the meat aisle - where I could further test my insane theory - I selected a pumpkin pie from the shelf and made a beeline for the register.


As much as I enjoy writing about my life "back in the day," from time to time I will ask you for your hometown memories.

This week I'm interviewing Brooklyn blogger Rob Lenihan.  His blog, The Luna Park Gazette, is home to  insightful opinion pieces, each with is own New York flavor.  In his twenty-plus years as a reporter, Rob has worked for CNNfn.com, The Street.com, The Bay Ridge Home Reporter, The Pocono Record, and the Waterbury Republican where he reported on crime, business and politics.  He now works for Thomson Reuters, a company that delivers information to businesses and professionals. 

Rob started blogging on January 17, 2005. He says: “I was unemployed, middle-aged, living with my elderly father, and wondering what the hell I was going to do next. I felt lost and starting a blog was like firing a flare gun into the night sky and hoping someone would see it. Well, they did, and I’ve met some tremendous people through the blog."

When I prodded Rob for his Brooklyn memories, this is what he had to say:


I once knew a kid that quacked all the time. I was in the second grade, and his name – I’ll give him a new one – was Mark Green.  Mark often came to school dressed like a forty year old man, which told us alot about how he was raised. He wore slacks instead of dungarees, and shirts and ties, even if it wasn’t time for assembly. He always wore black shoes, the kind with the rounded toe.  I was sure Mark didn’t enjoy the freedom most of us kids had to play afternoon street games of punch ball and hide-and-seek, until our cheeks were rosy, and we worked up an appetite.

In class, Mark drove my teacher, Mrs. Seltzer, nuts.

During attendance, when individual names were called, each child was supposed to answer “here,” or “present.” Mark always answered “Here! Quack-quack.”

Whenever he was called upon or he raised his hand to volunteer an answer he would say something like: "2 x 2 equals 4. QUACK!”

One afternoon, a particularly exasperated Mrs. Seltzer marched Mark up to her coat closet. She opened the door, grabbed him by his shoulders, and had him stare at his reflection in her full length mirror. 

“Look at yourself!” she screamed. “You are a boy – not a duck! You will never be a duck. Your name is Mark Green!  You have no feathers, and you do not swim in a lake.  You have a nose on your face - not a duck bill.  Now, young man, what do you have to say for yourself?”

Mark looked her squarely in the face and bellowed:  “Quack! Quack-quack-QUACK!” 

Frustrated, she left the classroom as the rest of us giggled nervously, but Mark seemed overjoyed that he’d gotten a rise out of her. Indeed, each time he quacked, (for it did not stop that day) a little smile appeared around his lips, like he knew a secret or something. I mean, we laughed too – what else can you do?  

His behavior was not simply reserved for the classroom.  He introduced himself as Mark Green Duck, as he quacked his way through recess.  And whenever his mother picked him up from school, he quacked over to her  vehicle.  (Her response was a roll of her eyes as she quickly ushered him into her car.)

I have to confess, don’t know what became of him after second grade - but I think that he must have moved, for I have no memory of him after that time. 

But – in my adult years, every so often I think of him.  I mean, what becomes of a fellow who quacks as a way to rebel against the establishment? Did he grow up to be a genius, or imbalanced? In second grade, I doubt he would have had the foresight to envision the impact of his behavior on the other students.  Or did Mark leave behind this unique calling card (or quacking card) in order to be remembered by some of his classmates in years to come?

If that was the method behind his madness, at least for me, the end result was just ducky.


When I was growing up, the bicycles parked in my garage were made up of various parts. Why buy a new one when all my father had to do was scour Brooklyn curb sides, and collect discarded kickstands, bicycle chains and handlebars?


My bicycles never looked like this.
Bent handlebars were straightened and soldered onto random frames that had been tossed into a neighbor's rubbish pile. Sometimes the “donated” front wheel was 19 inches, and the back wheel was 22 inches. I’d eyeball the mismatched wheels, and decide on the bicycle's workability.  Most of the time the bike looked like it had been built for a contortionist.  In order to ride it, I'd realign my body, hunching my chest and arching my back, as I stretched hands across the rusty over sized handlebars in a forward lean.

At any given time, I might have a banana seat suitable for a grown man, or a three year old. Each time I mounted a homemade bicycle and attempted to work a set of pedals that were just out of reach, my body stretched like a dancers to match its unique construction. It could be said, as I rode the Bike of Frankenstein through the streets of Brooklyn, I gained a freakish agility.     

While my friends paraded their new Schwinn bicycles around the neighborhood with plastic streamers stemming from the hand grips, I attached a rusty bell on my handlebars and weaved a playing card or two through the wheel spokes. I pretended not to notice their distaste.  The way I saw it, my bicycles may not have been pretty, but at least I always had a set of wheels.

Today, as I watch most of my colleagues work at their desks complaining about their necks, and making appointments with their chiropractors, it gives me pause to wonder:  Was a trip around the block on my bicycle more than just a lark?  Was I also engaged in some primitive form of physical therapy?

Of course, the answer doesn't matter now.  But while the desk jockeys around me pop aspirin and grumble about their aching backs, it should be said I sit in my chair with a neck that remains supple and a spine that is in perfect alignment.


It was 1970, and the price of a slice of pizza was about to rise from 35 to 40 cents. Although most fourth graders didn't mind spending an extra nickel at Pizza Stop, our Friday afternoon hangout, I was immediately presented with a problem.  At the current price, two slices of pizza and a drink cost ninety cents, with a dime left over to spend at the candy store.  Now a dollar wouldn't stretch quite as far, and for me, something would have to be eliminated.

I convinced my friends we had no choice but to stage a protest.  We would force the pizzeria to reconsider this unnecessary increase.  And so we made signs: “Pizza Stop Stops you from living!” And “Pizza – Stop!” For a week, several girls in saddle shoes and pleated skirts armed with oak tag signs marched outside of the pizzeria.  We screamed out slogans, and badgered other patrons to join the protest. At first the owners were amused at the spectacle, but as the week rolled on, I'm sure they thought us a bit mad.

Today, when I reflect upon my short stint as a consumer advocate, I think about doing it again.  Fighting inflation on the front lines.  I could start with the food vendor truck camped out on the sidewalk at lunch time.  I mean, isn't $5.00 a tad expensive for a drink and a falafel sandwich? Would it be so bad if I stood in front of the falafel truck with a sign that said: “The price of falafel is ….. awful?”   

What if I stood in the produce aisle in the supermarket, held up a globe of lettuce. and shouted: “1.49! That's a lot of clams to shell out for a salad!"  

Perhaps these clumsy attempts at rallying the "man on the street" are outdated.  On the web, I could upload a video about the high price of gasoline, and point out the inflated prices in each of the supermarket flyers.  I'd call myself The Inflation Maven, and Tweet about the rising cost of cell phones and flat screen televisions.    

Though ideas buzz in my brain like bees circling a hive, I can't help but wonder:  At the falafel stand would hungry customers simply push past the crazy lady with the homemade sign?  In the supermarket, would  shoppers assume I'd forgotten to take any number of medications that are currently advertised on their new flat screen televisions?  Could I even  make a video interesting enough to go viral?

And then there's the one fact I can't ignore.  Despite my best efforts, the price of a slice of pizza inevitably rose to 40 cents.
