Today marks my twenty three years of existence. I thank God for giving me another year to live, to share my knowledge and skills, to experience and learn new things, to love, and to grow in Him.

I have always had faith in my God that He will lead me according to His plans. This year, I wanted to highlight a few of the things I am most thankful for, which makes me say that indeed He works in mysterious ways:
Work. He taught me to be patient and to continue praying for my new team and new role. His timing was perfect, as my transfer took place at the start of my employer's new fiscal year -- giving me a fresh start for everything.
Media. January 2010 saw my first ever published article in Manila Bulletin, occupying almost a whole page of the broadsheet. During the same month, Jove Francisco also mentioned my blog in TV5's defunct "The Evening News." After 10 months, my name and blog appeared again in Manila Bulletin recommending gadgets for Christmas. Who would've thought that I'd make it there? I am actually overwhelmed.
Travel. This year gave me another opportunity to go places to see God's wonderful creations. To name a few, I was able to visit Bacolod, Iloilo, Misibis Bay, Hong Kong, Boracay, Singapore, and Malaysia all at a very low airfare. I also have to thank Cebu Pacific and my sister for these.
Blog. My blog GLICH'S LIFE opened its doors to meeting new people, trying new restaurants, featuring different brands, and experiencing new things. I'd like to thank the people who have helped me and have given me opportunities to shine throughout the year.
Voice-Over. My voice may not be the best and deep as other talents but I thank God for Digicon Wizard Events Group and Summit Media among others for their unwavering support in getting me as a voice-over talent in their events. It just gives me the encouragement to do better each time.
Church. For the entire year, I was able to faithfully serve God through the worship band ministry once a month and was able to fulfill my faith pledge. These are just two of the things that I can do to give back a portion of what God has blessed me with.
Family. My family rarely finds time to gather as one to eat together. This year, I can vividly remember four times that we did -- Mother's Day, grandpa's wake, Mom's birthday, and my birthday. In addition, I thank God for giving my mom the strength to face each challenge after she was operated in April, her dad left the world and her mom got confined in the hospital.
Friends. There were some who left and there are some who said hello. I may have a few friends around, but I know their genuine friendships are here to stay. To all my friends who have continuously showed their support, care, and love for me in times I feel down and happy, you are God's many gems in my life.
Indeed, I have so many things to be thankful for. I may not be able to list them down here, but I can tell you that God has given me so much. More blessings and more challenges in the next years to come! Cheers to my 23rd birthday!



After a month of intimate relationship, I finally waved goodbye to the Nokia N8 as it goes back to the hands of WOMWorld in UK. Over the past month, we have seen the unboxing video of the phone, some tips on how to maximize the N8, and a cheaper price of the phone in the gray market. This post is more of a summary of my likes and dislikes about the phone.


The Tomas Morato area in Quezon City has a lot of hidden food finds, where one of them is Chef's Bistro located in Scout Gandia. November 7 saw the launching of their breakfast buffet at only Php118.00, which is offered only every Sunday, from 7am-10am.

My relatives and I tried the buffet, and I can say that it was worth the price overall. Initially offering some traditional dishes, they plan to serve simple, provincial dishes in the succeeding Sundays, so diners can have a unique breakfast experience.

Parking can be quite a challenge, since the facade of the restaurant is a little small. Chef's Bistro has two floors with both indoor and outdoor tables. It's a little bit sunny on a Sunday morning, so I suggest you call for a reservation to be seated inside the restaurant.

You can see few tables at the ground floor and two function rooms at the second, which can sit about 14 and 30 people, respectively.

The room was so full when we got there and the moving space was small, so I suggest to get food as much as you can consume in order to lessen the movement to and from your seats.

With the price we paid, we were able to eat our favorite food like tapa, tocino, spicy bangus, bacon and chorizo, ham and egg, arrozcaldo, ground beef, as well as desserts like fruit salad and ginataan. Coffee or juice wasn't included in the buffet. But I always go for water anyway, since I don't want to get full from drinks. *pardon the pictures, I'm not a photographer*








Chef's Bistro started back in 2008 as the brainchild of Chef Paul Tee. By July 2010, partners Peewee Dela Cruz and Charmaine Tang assumed the ownership, while Chef Paul acted as their consultant. Why? Chef Paul wanted to focus on his establishment in Davao, but didn't want to close down what he has started in QC. As this is the case, new owners preserved what Chef Paul started, but made a few improvements on the food and operations.

So if you're from the QC area, you don't have to go to Eastwood anymore to satisfy yourself with an inexpensive breakfast buffet that has the same food every time. I am definitely going back one of these days. In fact, I'm already planning to try their main courses, as I heard they are really delicious.

One week. That's how long since I have seen my old teammates. It was last Thursday, October 28 when we celebrated three occasions -- two birthdays and my despedida. I have transferred to a new team since then, and looking back, I want to share with you what we had at the celebration.

We ordered pizza, lasagna, buko pandan, and chicken lollipops from El Buono Pizza and CCME Homemade Foodstuff.

22-inches Pizza (2 flavors at Php1,900++)

El Buono Pizza claims to be Asia's biggest and finest pizza. They have branches in Makati, Paranaque and Mandaluyong, and offers various sizes from their smallest slice, 10 inches, 12 inches to 22 inches and their biggest at 35 inches.

After watching the movie Eat. Pray. Love., I have been looking forward to eating a pizza that's soft, thin and delicious. Surprisingly, El Buono Pizza gave me that! It's the first time we've actually tried it, and I can tell that they now have a fan in me.

C.C. Mercado Enterprises (CCME) Homemade Foodstuff, on the other hand, offers not just pizzas but a wide variety of main and side courses. You can order ala carte food items or choose from their packages -- all of which are really budget-friendly.

Chicken Lollipops (~40pcs at Php515)


Beef Lasagna (1 tray or 2kg. at Php450)


Buko Pandan (1 gallon tray at Php360)


All the items we ordered were yummy and enough to feed more than 15 people. Our team has been a regular customer of CCME, since their food items are not that expensive, comes in big servings, and delivers to Taguig at just Php150.

I may not exactly miss the work I did in my previous role, but it is the people in my team that will surely be missed. Moving to a new role and team is as challenging as starting all over again, but I believe God has His perfect plan for me.

It's the first time that we've actually went to a cemetery and spent the few hours of November 1st in there. My lolo died last July, so it will be a tradition to go and visit him every All Saints' Day.

His remains were placed inside a temple at the Heritage Memorial Park. Most of the boxes are still empty, although some were already reserved and bought for future use.

Remembering our Lolo, we paid respect by following Chinese traditions like lighting incense sticks, uttering prayers, offering food and fruits, lighting candles, and putting white flowers.

We also did the folding of papers with gold/silver patches, and burned them -- these symbolize money, which is believed to be brought to afterlife by the deceased loved ones.

After more than three hours, we departed Heritage and went to my cousin's house for a get together over lunch. These are what we ate there, which explains why my tummy is super happy again.

And about the ghost -- I really think it was a ghost. I heard a voice from the left side of the temple that seemed to be an old person crying. The crying sound went on for about a minute, and was very distinct. It wasn't a hallucination, it was for real.

However, when my Tita and I went around the back of the hall where my Lolo's ashes were placed, we didn't see anyone. It was also almost impossible for anyone to go there, since all the boxes are still empty. So the question now is, was that a real ghost or just some people trying to scare us? Did you encounter something similar?
