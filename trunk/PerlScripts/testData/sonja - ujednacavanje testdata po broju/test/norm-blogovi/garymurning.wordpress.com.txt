Early this afternoon I received the first copy of Children of the Resolution for approval. I did have a few doubts before receiving it, as I’m sure you’ll understand, regarding the quality of the end product but, blessedly, I really don’t think I could have been happier. As it’s turned out, it’s as professionally bound and printed as any other quality paperback. The typesetting is perfect and the large format 6” x 9” paperback, with its glossy cover, really does, I think, justify the slightly higher price.

Below is a photograph of the book itself beside a copy of If I Never, just so you can get an idea of the size difference.

The book has now been approved and is currently being submitted for distribution – which means it should be listed on major bibliographic databases and available on online retailers worldwide (Amazon, Barnes & Noble etc) within 6 to 8 weeks. If, however, you don’t feel you can wait that long, it can now be bought directly (I believe) here. Please bear in mind, though, the retail price does not include p&p; unlike Amazon, I don’t think there’s a free postage option available (though I may be mistaken – please let me know if I am).

Given my do-it-yourself approach with this particular project, I do have little in the way of marketing/promotional support. So if you read the samples/the book and enjoy, please don’t forget to recommend it to others.

Thanks in advance and happy reading!

Today ?– by way of a taster – I’d like to share with you the prologue and first two chapters of Children of the Resolution, my first foray into the world of self-publication.

As previously mentioned, the principle reason for my choosing to self-publish this piece is that my existing publisher, Legend Press, does not feel that it fits with If I Never. This is something I can understand, though I do believe that, whilst rather different to If I Never, it is a piece of work many of my existing readers would appreciate.

Very much inspired by my own experience of the integration of disabled children into mainstream education in the 1970s/1980s, Children of the Resolution is nonetheless a work of fiction. I have very deliberately avoided overdramatising, however; whilst I could not write it as straight autobiography, neither could I create a false narrative – that would have felt too much like a betrayal.

Intended as the first in a series of books focusing on the life of Carl Grantham, it explores the educational climate of the time, focusing on the almost revolutionary zeal that, ultimately, faded away. More than that, however, it is a story of friendship – of loss and hope in a world where there should always be further potential adventures in store.

Today, it’s my great pleasure to announce my new – and, I think, rather spiffing – If I Never Christmas special. I’m very excited about it and know that you will be just as blown away by this fantastic offer as I am (no, trust me, you will… stop sniggering… look, I’m being serious… oh, okay – maybe not “blown away”, exactly, then, but you will think it’s a bit good… I hope).

A couple of weeks ago I commissioned the very excellent Big Little Badge Company to produce a strictly limited edition run of I [heart] If I Never badges. When I originally discussed this with Paul at the BLBC, I wasn’t 100% convinced that they could create an image based on the If I Never cover that would work. But how wrong I was! The end result, as I’m sure you will agree, is pretty fantastic.

So, the answer to the question I know you’re all asking. How do you get your hands on one of these shiny wonders?

It’s really quite simple. Anyone who buys the book through Amazon in the run up to Christmas will, by sending proof of purchase to me by e-mail (click here), together with their postal address, be very promptly sent a badge. Those who have already bought the book and are buying another copy as a Christmas present for a friend have the choice of either keeping the badge themselves, or passing it on.

I must stress that this is a very limited offer. I’m quite sure there will be enough to go around but – just in case there’s more of a demand than I originally envisaged – I would urge you to get ordering ASAP.

As some of you may have noticed, I’ve been fairly quiet over the past few days. There has been a reason for this – one that, ultimately, has led me to make a decision that I’m now actually quite excited about.

After discussing recent projects with my publisher, Legend Press, I have realised that not all my work will, by default, fit their very excellent list. My writing covers a wide range of styles and not all of my novels fall into the fast paced, plot driven scheme of If I Never. Much of my work is contemplative and – whilst it always has that page to page readability – is not always concerned with delivering thrills and spills. Legend’s focus on pacier, more plot driven work is certainly not something I’m averse to; I enjoy writing that kind of novel when a suitable candidate presents itself – but, naturally, I have to write the novel that most readily presents itself to me. To do anything other, I know from experience, is to sound a creative death knell.

This, naturally, leaves me with work that is simply sitting on my hard drive doing nothing. It’s work that, I believe, many of my readers will enjoy. I could, of course, submit this work to other publishing companies – something I intend to do with newer projects, those, that is, not suitable for Legend Press’s list – without impacting on future Legend Press novels (of which they should hopefully be more in the pipeline very soon). This, however, is a slow process and not appropriate for all of the projects I have almost ready to go.

I have therefore decided to self publish – for the time being – one of these projects, with the possibility of more should this prove successful. Something of a self publishing sceptic in the past, I’ve now come to realise that this could work quite well, in tandem with my existing, traditional publishing career, the self published work representing more personal projects – those I feel strongly about and which don’t quite fit the traditional publishing vein.

The project in question is one that many of you will already be very familiar with. A semi-autobiographical , character driven piece – Children of the Resolution.

This is completely my project. I expect to have it available within 6 to 8 weeks (I would ideally like it out before Christmas, of course, but that may not be possible). It is not yet available for pre-order but, by way of a taster, I do have the cover prepared. Let me know what you think!

After yesterday’s brief post featuring the video of Anderson Cooper‘s interview with the ever erudite and refreshingly honest Christopher Hitchens, I’ve noticed a couple of things.

My page hits have increased substantially.
I can’t help wondering how I myself, as an atheist and in many respects, to use Hitch’s preferred noun, anti-theist, will deal with what I’m sure we can safely assume is for each and every one of us an inevitability.
Last year – in fact it’s coming up to the anniversary – I had what ultimately turned out to be a not too serious sudden-onset medical problem that resulted in my being hospitalised at five o’clock in the morning. As many of my regular readers know, I have Type II (more or less) spinal muscular atrophy. In my case it’s categorised as a “severe” physical disability. Nonetheless, I’ve been fortunate enough to enjoy remarkably good health for many years. I’m disabled, not ill. Consequently, finding myself vomiting blood at five in the morning was something of a shock to the system.

Once at the hospital, however, it seemed that there wasn’t all that much to be concerned about. It looked like a fairly minor stomach bleed – most likely caused by the pinprick ulcers they eventually found. However, just as I was getting close to being discharged my Hb levels plummeted. We later found out that this was likely to have been a false reading, but at the time we didn’t know this – and given that they were having considerable problems getting a new, viable line into me… I was scared.

Of course, this was nothing like Hitch’s situation. But it’s as close as I’ve come recently. Ever, for that matter.

I was ill. Not as ill as any of us thought at that time – but I was weak, I hadn’t been eating and I think I was probably in shock. At one point, I can’t recall when, exactly, I seemed to click onto autopilot. I stopped thinking the way I normally would and simply focused on what was happening at that particular time. Things like writing novels, getting published, they became irrelevant. I sensed on that primitive level that death was a possibility – that it’s always a possibility.

So did I pray? Hitchens has talked about this extensively since his diagnosis. The religious among us – some, at least – trot out the tried and tested (and failed) “there are no atheists in foxholes“, sometimes just a little too smugly, and even dyed in the wool atheists like me find ourselves wondering what we’d do, even as we acknowledge that it’s something we haven’t as yet even contemplated resorting to in any real or meaningful way.

What many seem to completely miss when they refer to their foxholes is that for some of us, religion, the concept of gods, isn’t something from which we’ve escaped. It’s never really been there. Granted, we may have during our schooling gone through the predicated motions, but as adults it’s never been a question of rejecting god – he, she or it was never there to begin with. Certainly not in the way that people of faith experience. (I stress: for some of us.) And, so, the impulse to return to something in which we once found comfort just isn’t there.

And this is how it was for me. I’ve never depended upon gods. Even as a child, I never seriously asked expecting to receive. If I wanted love, if I wanted support – it was there, always, in the form of my parents. I didn’t have to ask.

So, no, I didn’t pray. I acquiesced to the knowledge of those around me – the doctors and nurses (although I wasn’t all that passive; I did constantly question) – and found the emotional support I needed in my parents. Had the prognosis been graver, would this have been the case? I’m pretty sure it would have been.
