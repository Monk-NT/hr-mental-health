I had to admit, I have mixed feelings about the upcoming movie Thor. I’m a fan of the Marvel comics character, partially because I’m a fanatic about Norse mythology.
But then I heard that Kenneth Branagh was directing, and though he has directed some good movies, they’ve mostly been Shakespeare works. How would that translate to an action superhero movie?
I also saw some early stills from the movie and I wasn’t that impressed with the costumes – they looked plastic in the stills.
But today Marvel released a teaser trailer for Thor. After watching it, I may be swaying back towards a bit excited. The visuals – both for Asgard and Earth – look well done, and I like that Natalie Portman is playing the love interest.
The trailer shows Thor being banished from Asgard by Odin, him being discovered by Portman and a bit of the battles between Thor and his brother Loki, and Thor and the Frost Giants.
Here’s the trailer. Check it out and tell me what you think.

Thor stars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Anthony Hopkins, Rene Russo and Tom Hiddleston. It opens everywhere in 2D and 3D on May 6, 2011.

Sunday afternoon – a beautiful day in Orlando, I might add – I hopped in the car and headed over to the Orlando Science Center. It’s a really cool place, but I wasn’t there to see the exhibits. I was there to attend the very first meet-up of the Central Florida TBEX chapter.
TBEX stands for Travel Bloggers Exchange, and it is a web community where travel writers/bloggers can get together, share links, ask questions and basically serve as a support group for each other.
Well, Ben Reed of Adventures with Ben, decided to bring the online offline and form a local chapter of TBEX, to allow travel bloggers in Central Florida (actually any travel blogger passing through is welcome) to discuss the whole art (business?) of travel blogging.
Other than my fellow Uptake blogger Miss Britt, I’d never met any of the other bloggers in person – though I had been following Bess at Central FL Top 5.
I think towards the end, we got into a good discussion of how to get your blog more noticed, and how individually-produced travel blogs can compete with the huge corporate conglomerate blogs for readers.
After the meet-up, we gathered for a group photo (some members were MIA due to travels of their own) and then I checked out some exhibits on the way to pick up Rhonda from work.
This first meeting was a good one and I look forward to the next one in January. I’m hoping over time that we can grow into a cohesive enough of a unit that not only can we help each other out, but maybe even do some regional traveling together. Wouldn’t that be fun?
If you’re a travel blogger, you should join TBEX – it’s free and it’s nice to have a supportive group of people to bounce things off of. Make sure you sign up for the CFL TBEX group at that site, too.
I should note that Adventures with Ben and Central Florida Top 5 did posts on their views of the event. I also did a short post over at CitySurfing Orlando about this.
The other bloggers attending can be found online at the links below:

I don’t just write here. I also contribute articles and posts elsewhere on the web. So in case you’ve missed any of them, I compile a monthly listing of all of the links.

It’s no secret I’m not a fan of the reality TV show genre.
Oh, sure from time to time, I’ve caught a few episodes of the competition-type of show (Top Chef, America’s Got Talent, Last Comic Standing), and that’s usually because Rhonda has control of the TV.
I almost never voluntarily put on a reality show, though. I’d rather watch a scripted show with real actors. To me, most of the popular reality shows are just excuses for people to act badly in the hopes of getting bigger ratings, and really, is this the kind of society we really want to celebrate?
So all that said, while I tolerate the reality show genre as a whole, I am totally appalled at a new competition show airing on E! Television called, “Bridalplasty.”
The whole concept of this show is that they have 12 brides who’ve made a wishlist of cosmetic surgeries they’d like to have done before their wedding.
They then compete against each other in challenges related to weddings – cakes, flowers, etc. If they win a challenge, they get to pick one surgery off the list and have it done.
The final bride – the big “winner” – gets everything off her list done and a $100,000 wedding. The show is hosted by former Miss USA Shanna Moakler, who has had plastic surgery done on her own body.
Now, granted, some of the contestants have some legitimate reasons for wanting a particular surgery. A breast cancer survivor who had a mastectomy wants implants. Another lost 100 pounds and wants the extra saggy skin removed. But for the most part, it’s just wanting to conform to the ideal of being perfect.
In one of the clips I saw, the winner of one elimination challenge got to take a syringe upstairs to the doctor on hand and have any injectible procedure done (botox, etc).
To me, this show just trivializes how painful and even life threatening plastic surgery can be. It just glamorizes the world of plastic surgery without showing the risks and dangers. This isn’t like “Nip/Tuck” where it was all make-believe. This is real life, with real consequences.
And really, what is the entertainment value of watching 12 women, unhappy with their looks, compete for the chance to be transformed via plastic surgery? I mean we’ve obviously become a very voyeuristic society with top-rated shows like “Jersey Shore” and “The Real Housewives of …..” and all those “I’m going on TV to find my true love” type of shows (really, you can’t find someone in real life, so you have to go on TV with a bunch of strangers and make that life-long connection in a matter of weeks???). But I really think this show has crossed the line.
I haven’t seen the ratings on this show, but I’m hoping it gets canceled before the end of this first season. I’d really hate to think this is where we are headed as a society when we find this kind of show “entertaining.”

I would have to say 2010 has been one of the most tumultuous years ever in my 43 years on this planet.
There’s still one month left and already I’ve dealt with being laid off my day job; having the condo I rented go into foreclosure forcing a quick move to a new apartment;  having a heart attack the day after I started the move; and having heart surgery on my birthday.
But I have a lot to be thankful for, so here’s my list of the top reasons 2010 didn’t totally suck.  I promise it’ll be shorter than a Grammy or Oscar speech.
1] I’m thankful I’m still alive. The blockage in my arteries was so severe the doctor said I might not have made it to 2011 if I hadn’t had the surgery. But I did, and everyday I feel myself getting stronger. I still have bad days here and there, and I’ve still got the MS to contend with, but it’s amazing how just having a strong flow of blood in my body makes me feel so, well, alive.
2] I’m thankful for my best friend Rhonda. We’ve been best friends for 22 years and roommates for a good portion of that, off and on. She’s like the sister I never had and without her support, I don’t know if I’d have been able to stay strong through some of the things I’ve had to deal with the last five years.
3] I’m thankful for my friends. They’re the family I choose to have and they have truly supported me this year, especially on those days I wasn’t sure I wanted to fight the good fight.
4] I’m thankful for the love of my dog. She always keeps me in good spirits and makes me laugh. She also cuddles against me when she senses I’m not feeling well. If only she could talk…err…wait, maybe that might not be a good idea. LOL
5] I’m thankful for the ability to laugh. As long as I can still laugh at something – anything – I have a chance of making my life happier.
6] I’m thankful for being able to earn a living at something I love to do. So what if I’m always working. I like what I do and it’s allowed me to meet some really great people and have some amazing experiences. Now if only the money was better…
7] I’m thankful for social media, especially Facebook and Twitter. It’s allowed me to reconnect with people I’ve lost touch with. High school friends, co-workers at Virgin Megastore, bands I used to hang out with, and more. It also enables me to stay in touch with my friends, since we all live such busy lives.
8] I’m thankful that some mysterious angel took care of my hospital bill. I had no idea how I would have come up with $45,000. I can’t even afford to fix my car. But somehow it all got taken care of and I have the receipt from the hospital (that I’m guarding with my life!) to prove it.
9] I’m thankful that people read my writing. And send me nice emails and twitter messages that they actually liked what they read. Sometimes writing is such a solitary job that it’s nice to have the validation that I’m on the right track, and that the info I put out there is actually helping somebody. Plus, on some of the places I write for online, I get paid by page views and ad clicks, so every set of eyes on a story or post helps (see above comment about better pay…).
10] I’m thankful my mom and gramma are watching over me from the heavens. I feel their presence often and several times a month, I dream about them. I miss them terribly, especially around the holidays, but I know they’re never too far away in spirit.
As I close out the year, I really feel positive (mostly) about what the coming year will bring me.  I hope it plays out that way. But in the meantime, I’m truly thankful for what I have and, more importantly, who I have in my life.
Thanks for reading my blog!
