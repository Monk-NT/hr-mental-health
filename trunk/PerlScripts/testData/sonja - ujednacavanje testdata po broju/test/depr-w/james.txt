While this exchange of pleasantries took place between
the two Ralph Touchett wandered away a little, with his
usual slouching gait, his hands in his pockets and his little
rowdyish terrier at his heels. His face was turned toward
the house, but his eyes were bent musingly on the lawn;
so that he had been an object of observation to a person
who had just made her appearance in the ample doorway
for some moments before he perceived her. His attention
was called to her by the conduct of his dog, who had
suddenly darted forward with a little volley of shrill barks,
in which the note of welcome, however, was more
sensible than that of defiance. The person in question was
a young lady, who seemed immediately to interpret the
greeting of the small beast. He advanced with great
rapidity and stood at her feet, looking up and barking
hard; whereupon, without hesitation, she stooped and
caught him in her hands, holding him face to face while
he continued his quick chatter. His master now had had
time to follow and to see that Bunchie’s new friend was a
tall girl in a black dress, who at first sight looked pretty.
She was bareheaded, as if she were staying in the house—a
fact which conveyed perplexity to the son of its master,
conscious of that immunity from visitors which had for
some time been rendered necessary by the latter’s illhealth.
Meantime the two other gentlemen had also taken
note of the new-comer.
‘Dear me, who’s that strange woman?’ Mr. Touchett
had asked.
‘Perhaps it’s Mrs. Touchett’s niece—the independent
young lady,’ Lord Warburton suggested. ‘I think she must
be, from the way she handles the dog.’
The collie, too, had now allowed his attention to be
diverted, and he trotted toward the young lady in the
doorway, slowly setting his tail in motion as he went.
‘But where’s my wife then?’ murmured the old man.
‘I suppose the young lady has left her somewhere: that’s
a part of the independence.’
The girl spoke to Ralph, smiling, while she still held up
the terrier. ‘Is this your little dog, sir?’
‘He was mine a moment ago; but you’ve suddenly
acquired a remarkable air of property in him.’
‘Couldn’t we share him?’ asked the girl. ‘He’s such a
perfect little darling.’
Ralph looked at her a moment; she was unexpectedly
pretty. ‘You may have him altogether,’ he then replied.
The young lady seemed to have a great deal of
confidence, both in herself and in others; but this abrupt
generosity made her blush. ‘I ought to tell you that I’m
probably your cousin,’ she brought out, putting down the
dog. ‘And here’s another!’ she added quickly, as the collie
came up.
‘Probably?’ the young man exclaimed, laughing. ‘I
supposed it was quite settled! Have you arrived with my
mother?
‘Yes, half an hour ago.’
‘And has she deposited you and departed again?’
‘No, she went straight to her room, and she told me
that, if I should see you, I was to say to you that you must
come to her there at a quarter to seven.’
The young man looked at his watch. ‘Thank you very
much; I shall be punctual.’ And then he looked at his
cousin. ‘You’re very welcome here. I’m delighted to see
you.’
She was looking at everything, with an eye that
denoted clear perception—at her companion, at the two
dogs, at the two gentlemen under the trees, at the
beautiful scene that surrounded her. ‘I’ve never seen
anything so lovely as this place. I’ve been all over the
house; it’s too enchanting.’
‘I"m sorry you should have been here so long without
our knowing it.’
‘Your mother told me that in England people arrived
very quietly; so I thought it was all right. Is one of those
gentlemen your father?’
‘Yes, the elder one—the one sitting down,’ said Ralph.
The girl gave a laugh. ‘I don’t suppose it’s the other.
Who’s the other?’
‘He’s a friend of ours—Lord Warburton.’
‘Oh, I hoped there would be a lord; it’s just like a
novel!’ And then, ‘Oh you adorable creature!’ she
suddenly cried, stooping down and picking up the small
dog again.
She remained standing where they had met, making no
offer to advance or to speak to Mr. Touchett, and while
she lingered so near the threshold, slim and charming, her
interlocutor wondered if she expected the old man to
come and pay her his respects. American girls were used to
a great deal of deference, and it had been intimated that
this one had a high spirit. Indeed, Ralph could see that in
her face.
‘Won’t you come and make acquaintance with my
father?’ he nevertheless ventured to ask. ‘He’s old and
infirm—he doesn’t leave his chair.’
‘Ah, poor man, I’m very sorry!’ the girl exclaimed,
immediately moving forward. ‘I got the impression from
your mother that he was rather—rather intensely active.’
Ralph Touchett was silent a moment. ‘She hasn’t seen
him for a year.’
‘Well, he has a lovely place to sit. Come along, little
hound.’
‘It’s a dear old place,’ said the young man, looking
sidewise at his neighbour.
‘What’s his name?’ she asked, her attention having
again reverted to the terrier.
‘My father’s name?’
‘Yes,’ said the young lady with amusement; ‘but don’t
tell him I asked you.
They had come by this time to where old Mr.
Touchett was sitting, and he slowly got up from his chair
to introduce himself.
‘My mother has arrived,’ said Ralph, ‘and this is Miss
Archer.’
The old man placed his two hands on her shoulders,
looked at her a moment with extreme benevolence and
then gallantly kissed her. ‘It’s a great pleasure to me to see
you here; but I wish you had given us a chance to receive
you.’
‘Oh, we were received,’ said the girl. ‘There were
about a dozen servants in the hall. And there was an old
woman curtseying at the gate.’
‘We can do better than that—if we have notice!’ And
the old man stood there smiling, rubbing his hands and
slowly shaking his head at her. ‘But Mrs. Touchett doesn’t
like receptions.’
‘She went straight to her room.’
‘Yes—and locked herself in. She always does that.
Well, I suppose I shall see her next week.’ And Mrs.
Touchett’s husband slowly resumed his former posture.
‘Before that,’ said Miss Archer. ‘She’s coming down to
dinner—at eight o’clock. Don’t you forget a quarter to
seven,’ she added, turning with a smile to Ralph.
‘What’s to happen at a quarter to seven?’
‘I’m to see my mother,’ said Ralph.
‘Ah, happy boy!’ the old man commented. ‘You must
sit down—you must have some tea,’ he observed to his
wife’s niece.
‘They gave me some tea in my room the moment I got
there,’ this young lady answered. ‘I’m sorry you’re out of
health,’ she added, resting her eyes upon her venerable
host.
‘Oh, I’m an old man, my dear; it’s time for me to be
old. But I shall be the better for having you here.’
She had been looking all round her again—at the lawn,
the great trees, the reedy, silvery Thames, the beautiful old
house; and while engaged in this survey she had made
room in it for her companions; a comprehensiveness of
observation easily conceivable on the part of a young
woman who was evidently both intelligent and excited.
She had seated herself and had put away the little dog; her
white hands, in her lap, were folded upon her black dress;
her head was erect, her eye lighted, her flexible figure
turned itself easily this way and that, in sympathy with the
alertness with which she evidently caught impressions. Her
impressions were numerous, and they were all reflected in
a clear, still smile. ‘I’ve never seen anything so beautiful as
this.’
‘It’s looking very well,’ said Mr. Touchett. ‘I know the
way it strikes you. I’ve been through all that. But you’re
very beautiful yourself,’ he added with a politeness by no
means crudely jocular and with the happy consciousness
that his advanced age gave him the privilege of saying such
things—even to young persons who might possibly take
alarm at them.
