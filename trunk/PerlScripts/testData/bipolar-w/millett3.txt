It was Sally's idea after all to have me seen by a doctor at Highlands
Hospital in Oakland. lt was July then too, seven years ago, in Califor-
nia. The first bust. Detained on a seventy-two-hour observation hold, l
was transferred at once from Highlands to Herrick Hospital in Berkeley.
When the three days were up at Herrick, Sally had me transferred to
Napa, where the clock began again.
Sally had decided Napa would be cheaper. And the law could be
stretched by moving me from Highlands to Herrick and then to Napa so
that the seventy-two hours—not counting court holidays. weekends, and
the Fourth of July—came to some ten days in the end. And a few more
for good measure, to look like a good sport while bargaining for my
freedom with a shrink at Napa, a man who didn't need trouble and now
could no longer hold me against my will. Since l seemed to be a stickler
for legality—whether l was crazy or not I obviously had a penchant for
civil liberties. Playing the good fellow and cleaning off his end of the
action, he promised me my freedom-—if l said l'd been hospitalized
voluntarily. The price both a lie and a gamble. It was a document I

hardly remember: Thorazine and fright; the entire maneuver a risk I
scarcely understood. But I would have signed anything to get out of
there and into daylight again.
A week later I arrived in St. Paul, stopping off to visit my mother on
my way to the farm, and she had me committed to the Mayo wing of the
University of Minnesota. That same moming the word went around
among the social workers, and by aftemoon civil liberties lawyers arrived at my side to demand a hearing to challenge commitment. We won
our trial ten days later. I was free again. And came here to the fann to
spend August, happy to be alone, alive and well. Freedom was everything after the hells I had seen stretching away into an etemity l glimpsed
as a college girl with a summer job as a psychiatric aide. St. Peter's
Asylum, a snake pit in southern Minnesota. Things hadn’t changed that
much in twenty years; the joints where I was an involuntary patient, a
prisoner, in Califomia and Minnesota, were not very different. Solitary
and the jacket still lurked about, but dope had replaced having to manage the inmates; drugged out, they managed themselves. At Napa we
used to stay up late surreptitiously guzzling instant coffee to counteract
the effects of Thorazine. Sitting up together, getting high, or rather
normal though it felt high, we became comrades on contraband. But
other nights in those places, television evenings, the crowded air around
the long rows of beds, the etemal night of those wards where you hardly
dare sleep lest you awake translated to some place worse than the
dungeon you close your eyes on . . . will this be the rest of my life?
At St. Peter's commitment was for life; most of those deposited there,
shrugged otf by their relatives, had been parked ten, fifteen, twenty
years ago. They would die there. Even at the newer places in Califomia,
at Napa for example, you'd tum and ask a very nice Belgian whose
papers were not quite in order and he’d say four years already. How long
had it been for that tall black undergraduate who loved to sail and
studied literature at Berkeley, he of the lovely Braque-like drawings —
have you saved the drawing he gave you? I-lave you forgotten them all,
have you forgotten the guy with the battered cowboy hat, another black
man, getting high on his coffee, the caffeine enabling us to talk at last,
even to talk fast, rebel talk, a thing the Thorazine frustrated entirely?
The bravado in that lovely hat, a gambler, a wit, our "dealer." The talk
making us comrades, breaking down the solitude, the isolation, the fear
and shame and despair; talking was organizing. And the poor stiff ones,
have you forgotten them too, mute as the old ladies in St. Peter‘s, those
blanked-out women at Napa who had forgotten how to write or talk,
who only mumbled to themselves? While you sped on, busily writing
letters on that humiliating ruled school paper, the regulation issue whose
very look would undermine your credibility with a bank or a lawyer,
whatever assistance you needed from the real world, a dead giveaway
even without your address. Back at the farm, your address and your
bank accounts straightened out nicely, the keys to your car and your
front door firmly in hand, have you forgotten it, imprisonment?
I think so. But that tone in Sally's voice reminds me again. Yes, I
took the lithium. All those years of forgiving those who imprisoned me,
realizing they were perplexed and felt they had no option, forgiving
them because they did not understand the consequences of their igno-
rance but still will never hear you when you try to explain.
But didn’t they take one look and shudder, knowing they themselves
would never consent to be locked inside there for an indetemiinate
period, a detention utterly at the behest and discretion of a doctor about
whom they know nothing and over whom they now have no control
whatsoever? He might as well be a cipher with a label on his chest, so
superstitiously have they responded to his license, his function. A func-
tion, it now emerges, they do not comprehend and can no longer influ-
ence. At his pleasure one can have electroshock, psychosurgery, all
manner of debilitating drugs, terms of incarceration of any length or
duress, solitary confinement, "restraints."
Then why quit taking lithium? Six years of diarrhea. Six years of hand
tremor in public places, on podiums, at receptions, at the moment one is
watched and observed. Six years of it in private while trying to draw, only
the greatest concentration stilling the Japanese brush to the perfect calm
it requires. Six years of being on a drug that made one sluggish, the mind
sedated, this suppressant. Rumors that it isn’t good for you in the long run,
the kidneys, the liver, maybe even the brain. Maybe the time had come
to try living without it. You don’t need it if you aren't a convicted manic
depressive. I was convicted but never convinced. What if l could get pos-
session of or even expunge my records? If not, this ‘ ‘take your medicine”
thing is going to dog me the rest of my days, like parole. I will be at the
mercy of anyone who knows my history and can invoke the authorities
against me. A few months o?° lithium without freaking out might prove
otherwise, establish my sanity. Absurd really, incapable of proof, but still
to lift the judgment against me would be to have my selfhood again, ab-
solved of the ever-present and proven charge of insanity. For which I can

be made to do time at any moment. Not an “illness” but a crime; for in
fact that's how it's seen. Lithium maintenance is only a suspended sen-
tence. What if I were innocent altogether? Sane all along? Rather than the
bearer of an incurable illness, a chronic recurrent disease, a rot in the very
heart of the brain, a cancer of the mind?
Accusing me of mania. my elder sister's voice has an odd manic quality.
“Are you taking your medicine?" A low controlled mania. the kind of
control in furious questions addressed to children, such as “Will you get
down from there?" At the end of my patience, I ask, “Will you ever
stop bossing me around?" But I am already scared and at the moment
I hang up I discover I am weeping.
As if by going off lithium I could erase the past, could prove it had never
happened, could triumph over and contradict my diagnoses; this way I
would be right and they would be wrong. It had always been the other way;
they were right and I was wrong. Of course I had only to take the lithium
in order to be accepted back. The ascription of madness was never lost,
it could be pulled forth at any moment, but on lithium I would be “all
right. " Are you all right?—always their first question, intense with a very
special intensity we both understood. We want you to be all right. they
say. especially Mother, meaning it so eamestly, benevolently. But I am
never all right. just in remission. If l could win this gamble. . . .
“The apprentices say you quarreled with your sister on the phone."
“For God’s sake, Sophie."
“Do you feel all right?”
“I feel fine, except that I am so angry at Sally and so hurt. She went
on and on about taking my lithium. In the most menacing way.”
“You must have provoked her. Forget about it, go swimming; it will
be dark soon. Kim and Libby have already gone in.”
I look at the pond and do not want to go swimming. “bet’s hope she
doesn't have the white coats up here. Do you realize she could declare
me incompetent?—-it's that easy, you know. If they get a bee in their
bonnet.“
“Don't be paranoid.”
“I'm not paranoid. It's the law. She could start on Mom. My sister
Mallory's just down in the city, they could get her stirred up two hours
away. And she’s next of kin. If I were locked up, what about the
farm?—they can make it so you don’t even own your own property."
Sophie goes on, looking at me across the white wrought-iron table.
