At the farm in Poughkeepsie just before dinner the ?rst evening light
is soft and almost violet. Sophie and I cross the grass in the circle drive
by the big locust, the gravel drive stretches just before us and beyond it
the farmhouse lawn where the tables are laid for dinner under the trees.
We are going to see the coop which Sophie has just ?xed up as her
studio. A barren New England shed, a chicken coop—she has transformed it. It is the South now, nearly tropical, “Like a New Orleans
whorehouse," I say, and we laugh. “But it’s perfect." I pace the room,
admiring it, remembering how they called them sporting houses, places
of the afternoon. The last passionate fullness of day, Sophie's straw
mats and bamboo hangings filtering the light. “How clever you are.”
The look between us grows into a suggestion. A quickie? “Do you
suppose there’s time before dinner or will the apprentices catch us in the
act?” she asks. We smile and look around the room at the spectacle of
light, the dark gleam inside, the light outside building, massive as
water, brilliant by contrast, overwhelming like the sea around a boat.
The beauty of what Sophie has created in a few casual hours takes my
breath away. I have known this place for years at nearly every hour of
the day, even worked here, yet I've never seen the room in this light;
Sophie has enchanted the place. This amazing woman, her intelligence,
her knack, her whim and instinct conceptualized, then realized. It's
genius, the way the light is caught and held by her hangings, the bamboo blinds placed at just the right junctures to ?lter and direct the light as it
floods in at the big openings in the wall to the front of the coop on the
southem and westem sides. There's the old camera from her family in
Canada mounted on its tripod as if in explanation, as if the camera had
taken a picture and we were in it. Oceans of light in the lens of the eye
opening to the masses of color in the fervent july sunset beginning now
just out of reach beyond the far westem wall, all the refracted yellows
and reds defused in the air around us — the room has become a camera.
How brilliant she is, this is beyond anything she has shown me before.
Bending over me, courting me, taking me, seducing me — the whole
structure a seduction, the most outrageous compliment that someone
would create this and then pay me the homage of showing it as a private
exhibition that would end in bedding me. The soft of her skin, her bare
shoulder against my lips, the pristine blue sheets under us, cobalt, their
color and the color of the golden light around us, one does not wish to
close one’s eyes, miss it.
And then they burst in on us, pirates of noise, Kim and Libby stumbling
in the door, laughing, knowing full well what they would displace.
Somehow their presence is a compliment to our love, just as they prevent it they also validate and applaud. We look at each other and cannot
find resentment. “Aha, we know just what you're up to, but you're too
late, the food is on the table. ” “Really on the table?" "Really. We give
you two minutes, exactly two minutes." They both laugh. "To make
yourselves decent." How they love it, being young and so full of sex
themselves, its energy, its ripe invitation; sexual appetite is a presence
in the room, its apprehension here is a celebration.
For they love us, as we love them, every day more so, friendship
becoming a drunkenness becoming love, a love none of us de?ne, so we
call it the fann or the colony, as if it were merely an idea, an ideology
of a communal something politically correct. Through it, rapturously
happy. Because of how we live? Because of who we are? Sophie and I
say it's because this year's bunch of apprentices is wonderful, they're
treasures. Calling them the kids, though we know they are young
women, young but already women.
Life has never been so good. The apprentices, the farm, the summer
still ahead, only half over, spreading already to a richness, a perfection,
like a peony in full bloom. Or the loosestrife around the pond. And Sophie. All, I have everything. I am even off the lithium. With no ill
effect. It is six weeks now we have been keeping check on the experiment, and if it works I am whole. Either I was never crazy or I have
recovered and can be sane henceforth. To be whole, not a cracked egg,
not an imperfect specimen, not a deformed intellect or a mental
defective — but whole. It‘s working, I’ll make it.
“Hey, come on, you guys, the cook will have a ?t." We look at each
other, face to face in the circle of bodies in this wonderful light; they are
by the door, between the door and the bed, their shapes already darkened against the light; leaning on an arm, you can smile up at each of
them, in love. With them, with the place, with Sophie. “Come on,
you’re already late.” Discovered now and on our way to dinner, crossing the grass with Sophie, I see the rest of them standing at the table to
toast, their glasses raised, the red wine in the glasses, the last light
cleansing and sparkling the glasses and plates along the straw place
mats, the different, warmer light of kerosene lantems on the wooden
boards of the table, and their long brown arms above their heads, raised
to toast with the pleasure of clinking glasses. “They're a wonderful
bunch," I say again to Sophie as we cross the grass. “The best we ever
had,” she says nodding. This is the happiest summer of my life.
