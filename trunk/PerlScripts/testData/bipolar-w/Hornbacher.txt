I am numb. I am in the bathroom of my apartment in Minneapolis, twenty years old, drunk, and out of my mind. I am cutting patterns in my arm, a leaf and a snake. There is one dangling light, a
bare bulb with a filthy string that twitches in the breeze coming through the open window. I look out on an alley and the
brick buildings next door, all covered with soot. Across the way a
woman sits on her sagging jowered couch in her slip and slippers,
watching TV, laughing along with the laugh track, and I stop to
sop up the blood with a rag. The blood is making a mess on the
floor (note to self: mop floor) while a raccoon clangs the lid of a
dumpster down below. Time hiccups; it is either later or sooner, I
can’t tell which. I study my handiwork. Blood runs down my arm,
wrapping around my wrists and dripping off my fingers onto the
dirty white tile floor.
I have been cutting for months. It stills the racing thoughts, re
lieves the pressure of the madness that has been crushing my mind,
viselike, for nearly my entire life, but even more so in the recent
days. The past few years have seen me in ever-increasing fiights
and falls of mood, my mind at first lit up with dashes of color,
currents of electric insight, sudden elation, and then flooded with
black and bloody thoughts that throw me face-down onto my living room floor, a swelling despair pressing outward from the center of my chest, threatening to shatter my ribs. I have ridden these
moods since I was a child, the clatter of the roller coaster roaring
in my ears while I clung to the sides of my little car. But now, at the
edge of adulthood, the madness has entered me for real. The thing
I have feared and railed against all my life — the total loss of control over my mind — has set in, and I have no way to fight it anymore.
I split my artery.
Wait: first there must have been a thought, a decision to do it, a
sequence of events, a logic. What was it? I glimpse the bone, and
then blood sprays all over the walls. I am sinking; but I didn’t
mean to; I was only checking; I’m crawling along the floor in jerks
and lurches, balanced on my right elbow, holding out my left arm,
the cut one. I slide on my belly toward the phone in my bedroom;
time has stopped; time is racing; the cat nudges my nose and paws
at me, mewling. I knock the phone off the hook with my right
hand and tip my head over to hold my ear to it. The sound of
someone’s voice — I am surprised at her urgency — Do you have
a towel — wrap it tight — hold it up — someones on their way
— Suddenly the door breaks in and there is a flurry of men, dark
shadows, all around me. I drop the phone and give in to the tide
and feel myself begin to drown. Their mouths move underwater,
their voices glubbing up, Is t/were a pulse? and metal doors clang
shut and I swim through space, the siren wailing farther and far-
ther away.
I am watching neon lights flash past above my head. I am lying
on my back. There is a quick, sharp, repetitive sound somewhere:
wheels clicking across a floor. I am in motion. I am being pro-
pelled. The lights flash in my eyes like strobe. The place I am in is
bright. I cannot move. I am sinking. The bed is swallowing me.
Wait, this is not a bed; there are bars. We are racing along. There
are people on either side of me, pushing the cage. They’re running.
What’s the hurry? My left arm feels funny, heavy. There is a stun-
ning pain shooting through it, like lightning, flashing from my
hand to my shoulder. It seems to branch out from there, shooting
electricity all through my body. I try to lift my arm but it weighs
a thousand pounds. I try to lift my head to look at it, to look
around, to see where I am, but I am unable to. My head, too, is
heavy as lead. From the corner of my eye, I see people watching
me fly by.
I am in shock. I heard them say it when they found me. She's in
shock, one said to the other. Who are they? They broke down the
door. Well, are they going to pay for it? I am indignant. l black our.
I come to. I am wearing my new white sweater. l regret that it is
stained dark red. What a waste of money. We have stopped mov-
ing. There are people standing around, peering down at me. They
look like a thicket of trees and I am lying immobile on the forest
floor. When did it happen? What did you use? they demand, their
voices very far away. I don’! remember — everyone calm down,
I ’ll just go home — can I go home? I feel a little sick — I vomit
into the thing they hold out for me to vomit into. I ’m so sorry, I
say, it was an accident. Please, I think I ‘ll go home. Where are my
shoes?
Am I saying any of this? No one stops. They bustle. I must be in
a hospital; that is what people do in a hospital, they bustle. For
hospital people, they are being very loud. There is shouting. The
bustling is unusually hurried. What’s the rush, people? My arm is
killing me, as it were, yuk yuk, though I can't really feel it so much,
am more just aware that it is there; or perhaps I am merely aware
that it was there, and now I am aware only of the arm-shaped
heaviness where it used to be. Have they taken my arm? Well,
that’s all right. Never liked it anyway, yuk yuk yulz.
No one is getting my jokes.

I realize I am screaming and stop immediately, feeling embarrassed at my behavior. I have to be careful. They will think I am
crazy.
I come to and black out. I come to and black out. This lasts forever, or it takes less than a minute, a second, a millisecond; it takes
so little time that it does not happen at all; after all, how would I
be conscious of losing consciousness? Is that, really, what it means
to lose your mind? Well, then, I don’t lose my mind very often after all. My arm hurts like a motherfucker: I object. I turn my head
to the person whose face is closest to me to tell him I object, but
suddenly he is all hands, and there is an enormous gaping red
thing where my arm used to be. It is bloody, it looks like a raw
steak, it looks like the word flesh, the word itself, in German fleish,
and the Bastard of Hands has one hand wrapped around my forearm, his fingers and thumbs on either side of the gaping red thing,
pressing it together, and he is sticking a needle into the inside
part of the thing— Quiet down! Someone hold her down, for
chrissalzes — and he stabs the inside of the thing again and again
and I hear someone screaming, possibly me. It does not hurt, per
se, but it startles me, the gleaming slender needle sinking into the
raw flesh. I realize I am a steak. They are carving me up to serve
me. They will serve me on a silver-plated platter. The man’s hands
are enormous, and now the hands are sewing the cut flesh, how
absurd! Can’t they just glue it together? What a fuss over nothing
— Oh, for God’s sake! I yell (perhaps, or maybe only think), now I
remember, and I scream (I’m pretty sure I really do), Can you be-
lieve I did it? What a fucking idiot! I didn't mean to! I plead with
them to understand this, I was only cutting a little, didn’t mean to
do it, sorry to make such a mess, look at the blood! And my
swealer! I black out and come to and black out again. You're in
shock. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Maria? She's com-
pletely out of it, one says to the other. They tower like giants. They
can’t pronounce my name. Its MAR-ya, I say, stressing the first
syllable. Yes, dear.
