It is, I say, it really is. Yes, dear, I know. I ’m sure
it is. ]ust rest. Fuming, I rest. How can they save my life if they
don’t even know how to say my name? They will save someone
else’s life instead! A woman named Maria! Why, I suddenly think,
should they have to save my life — oh, for God’s sake! I remember
again. I’ve gone and actually done it! Moron! How on earth will I
explain this? The pair of hands has sewn the inside flesh together
and is beginning another row on top of it. One row won’t do? Stu-
pid, says the Bastard of Hands. I look at him, shaking his head,
disgusted, stitching quickly. So damn stupid.
I want to say again that I didn’t mean it so he will not think I
am stupid. I watch blood drip from a bag above my head into a
thin tube that leads, I think, to me. I black out. I come to. There is
a giant belly in front of me. It touches the edge of the bed. I follow
the belly up the body to a very pretty face. Aha! Pregnant! Now I
understand. However, why is there a pregnant woman standing
next to me? Where is the hand man? Do you think you need to be
in the psych ward? God, no! I laugh at the very idea, wanting very
badly to seem sane. I prop myself up, forgetting about the arm,
and collapse back on it, screaming in pain. Note to self: don’t use
left arm. Why don’t you think you need to be in the psych ward?
she asks. I didn’t mean to! I cry. It was a total accident, I was making dinner, accidentally the knife slipped, not to worry, I wasn't
attempting (I cannot say the word) (there is a hollow between
words, which I fill with) (nicer, safer words). I am incredibly dizzy
and I wish she would go away so I could go home — who lets a
woman who’s just sliced her arm in half go home? Can you contract for safety? the pregnant psychiatrist asks. Who knew psychiatrists got pregnant? I can, I say, very earnest. You can agree that
you will not hurt yourself again if you go home? Absolutely, I say.
After all, I joke, I can't very well cut open the other arm — this
one hurts too much! I laugh hysterically, nearly falling off the bed.
She doesn’t think this is funny. She has no sense of humor.
She lets me go home. Hospital policy is to impose the least level
of restriction possible. If they think you can keep yourself safe, if
they can keep one more bed open in the psych ward, they let you
go home. And I’m very convincing. I contract for safety, swearing I
won’t cut myself up again. I call a cab and climb into it, dizzy, my
arm wrapped in thick layers of bandages. I return to a bloody
mess, and as dawn fills the room, I tell myself I’ll clean it up in the
morning.
I HAVE BEEN in and out of psychiatric institutions and hospitals
since I was sixteen. At first the diagnosis was an eating disorder —
years spent in a nightmare cycle of starving, bingeing, and purg-
ing, a cycle that finally got so bad it nearly killed me — but I’ve
been improving for over a year, and it’s all cleared up (brush off
hands). They think I’m a little depressed — that’s the assumption
they make for anyone with an eating disorder — so they give me
Prozac, new on the market now, thought to cure all mental ills,
prescribed like candy to any and all. Because I'm not, in fact, depressed, Prozac makes me utterly manic and numb — one of the
reasons I slice my arm open in the first place is that I’m coked to
the gills on something utterly wrong for what I have.
I am probably in the grip of a mixed episode. During manic
episodes or mixed episodes — which are episodes where both the
despair of depression and the insane agitation and impulsivity
of mania are present at the same time, resulting in a state of rabid, uncontrollable energy coupled with racing, horrible thoughts
— people are sometimes led to kill themselves just to still the
thoughts. This energy may be absent in the deepest of depressions,
whether bipolar or pure depression; the irony is that as people appear to improve, they often have a higher risk of suicide, because
now they have the energy to carry out suicide plans. Actually,
an alarming number of bipolar suicides are unintentional. Mania
triggers wildly impulsive behaviors, powerful urges to push oneself to the utmost, to go to often dangerous extremes — like driving a hundred miles an hour, bingeing on drugs and alcohol, jumping out of windows, cutting, and others. These extreme behaviors
lead, often enough, to accidental death.
Who knows, really, what leads to my sudden, uncontrollable
desire to cut myself? I don’t know. Is the suicide attempt acciden-
tal or deliberate? It certainly isn’t planned. Manic, made further
manic by the wrong meds, I simply do it, unaware in the instant
that there will be any consequence at all. I watch my right hand
put the razor in my left arm. Death is not on my mind.
No one even thinks bipolar — not me, not any of the many
doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, and counselors I’ve seen over the
years — because no one knows enough. Later, this will seem almost incredible, given what a glaring case of the disorder I actually have and have had nearly all my life. But how could they
know back then? With so little knowledge about bipolar disorder,
or really about mental illness at all, no one knows what to look
for, no one knows what they’re looking at when they’re looking at
me. They, and I, and everyone else think I’m just a disaster, a
screwup, a mess. On the phone, my grandfather demands, “So,
have you got your head screwed on right yet?” Yuk yuk yuk,
funny man, raging drunk. But you can’t blame him for the question. It’s the one everyone’s been asking since I was a kid. Surely
she’ll grow out of it, they think.
I grew into it. It grew into me. It and I blurred at the edges, became one amorphous, seeping, crawling thing.
